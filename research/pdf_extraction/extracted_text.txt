Theentire memetic magical system, including
especially Artistic Memetic Magic, canbeseen asa
modern re-manifestation ofthearchaic current of
shamanism. Shamanism hasbeen practiced foratleast
30,000 years, andvery possibly for aslong as
human-like organisms have inhabited theEarth. (Some
scientists believe that organisms very similar to
modern human beings have existed for atleast 3
million years) .Within thesociocultural matrixes
formed byWestern Civilization, thememetic magical
system would necessarily beseen bythemajority of
human inhabitants ofthose cultural systems asa
completely newandunique system resting ontwo
incrodlblo, borderline unbelievable claims. These
elaInin nrn thnt thrfabric ofreality can be
manipulated through nothing more complex than
artistic endeavor, and that thepower tocreate
powerful artwork canbeobtained simply bystrict
isolation .
But inthearchaic world, andthose modern
human tribes whostill have notsettled into rigidly
controlling agriculturally supported urban
sociocultural matrixes, very little contained within
the pages ofthis book would come asareal
revelation. Shamans, sorcerers, diviners, and
oracles have been practicing thevery same methods
under different linguistic guises for tens of
thousands of years, if not longer. Western
Civilization holds upexamples offake shamans,
sorcerers, diviners, andoracles tobring folly and
ridicule totraditions which threaten thestability
oftheir ownsociocultural matrixes which rest on
conformity toreligious, ideological, andeconomic
hegemonies. Certainly, there arefalse shamans and
those whoprey upon theignorance ofothers. But
Western Civilization haspurposefully forgotten and
ignored theundeniable truth that real shamans exist
inthepresent whotravel toareal underworld and
Memetic Magic 7


real sorcerers exist capable ofmanipulating thefabric ofreality. Magic isreal. Thespirit realmisreal.
Icandeclare without hesitation that thiswork isboth three-hundred years ahead ofitstimeand twothousand years behind its time. Western
Civilization isnotready toaccept thevalidity oftheconcepts underlying thememetic magical systemand thedisconcerting truth that individuals canmanipulate thefabric ofreality using asynergisticcombination ofisolation andartistic endeavor. Butatime will come when scientists will beforced tolook into thevalidity ofthespirit realm, forsince thespirit realm isreal, itexerts profound
influence upon theobjective material universe whichcannot beignored iftrue cause and effectrelationships aretobefully comprehended. Further,mental powers beyond those accepted bythemajorityofhuman beings arenotonly possible toattain butarebeing practiced byaminority ofthehumanpopulation today. Psychic phenomenon inall itsvarieties isreal. Human beings can, utilizing theproper techniques, read minds, implant thoughts intotheminds ofother conscious-possessing organisms,move matter, control invisible material forces, andlook into thepast and the future. The authorhimself hasaccomplished all ofthese supposedlyimpossible feats utilizing thetenets ofartisticmemetic magic. Itisclear Western Civilization mustonedayawaken totheawesome potentialities ofthehuman mind, butpeople inarchaic societies havealways known and still know such things are
possible.
When anthropologists andethnobotanists claimthat theageofshamanism israpidly coming toanend asmodern cultural matrixes engulf andabsorbarchaic cultural matrixes, they arespeaking without
atrue understanding ofthesource ofshamanism. Aslong ashuman organisms exist shamanism will neverbecome extinct.
Anthropologists have noted correctly
that shamans, bywhatever name they arelabeled intheir particular cultural matrixes, tend toutilizethesame techniques toobtain thesame results nomatter how far apart (whether physically,ideologically, orculturally) thespecific cultural
Manipulation oftheRoot Social Matrix&theFabric ofReality 8RMItrix«a may beinwhich those shamans resIda,
Anthropologists claim this uncanny similarity isdu«
toatrail anderror method acted outover aperiod
Ofmany thousands ofyears which ineffect filter/I
down the shamanic arts into those which are
affective according toasetofworking principals.
While they areprobably correct, atleast to
anextent, inmaking this claim, they aremissing a
vitally important point. Shamanism will not go
axtinct even ifallarchaic societies areswallowed
upbymodernism. Thereason for this isfairly
simple, butextraordinarily profound. Shamans are
those human beings whoare chosen bytheliving
entities within the spirit realm toact as
intermediaries between material objective reality
andthespiritual planes. Shamans arenottaught to
become shamans byother shamans, they aretaught to
become shamans bythespirits. Thespirits donot
reside incultural matrixes; they reside inthe
subconscious mind.
Hlrice the spiritual realm is anecessary
precondition foreonaciousnomj ofanyvariety, as
long anhumans possess free consciousness, spirits
will beabln tocontact those humans whom they wish
tocontact. Aslong asspirits cancontact human
beings, shamans will beborn. Notrove ofknowledge
isnecessary. Ifevery shaman perished, andevery
book onshamanism were tobeburned, newshamans
would continue toemerge, because shamanism isan
art taught notbybooks ormaterial means, but
directly bythespirits from theunconscious mind.
When thespirits decide toinitiate ahuman into
shamanism, they dosobyproviding thenecessary
knowledge tothe potential shaman through the
knowledge encoded within hisorhergenes viathe
medium ofthesubconscious mind.
This book isavalid demonstration ofthe
shamanic initiatory process. When this work came
flowing forth from theauthor's unconscious mind
onto thepages hewastyping, theauthor knew little
ofshamanism andonly thebarest outlines ofthe
concepts oftrue magic. Yetthis book came outof
himasthough itwere being written bysomeone else.
This, someone else wasofcourse aspiritual power
whohaddecided itwas time for theauthor to
Memetic Magic 9


fulfill hispotential asamodern shaman. Ifyou
don't believe that shamanism isanarttaught bythe
unconscious mind totheconscious mind ofthenew
shaman, simply utilize themethods contained within
this book. They work. Howelse could theauthor havecomebysuch knowledge?
Theonly true threat tothecontinuance of
shamanism isthefurther enslavement oftheminds of
humans forced toexist within social matrixes which
control thoughts andactions. Shamanic andmagical
powers cannot beobtained until amind isfreed from
thecontrol memes which dominate andform thefalse
conscious minds ofmost modern individuals. Aslong
ashuman beings areable toisolate themselves for a
specified period oftime from memetic influences
shamans will continue tobeborn. But ifatime
comes when isolation becomes impossible, thehuman
organism would becutofffrom itsspiritual roots,
and shamanism could then become extinct. Such
complete control oftheminds ofindividuals might
bepossible, particularly iftechnological devices
such ascomputers, communication systems, and
entertainment devices were tobeimplanted directly
into human organisms. Such technological devices are
already capable ofbeing made. Itisonly amatter
oftime before these items aremass-produced and
distributed tothecitizens ofWestern Civilization.
POWER ANIMALS ANDMYTHICAL CREATURES
Shamans traveling tothe underworld (the
subconscious mind) often come into contact with
mythical creatures such asdragons, unicorns, orthe
like. Also very common are hybrid creatures
consisting ofmany different animals inconjunction;
forexample ahuman body with thehead ofabird.
Many shamans consider power animals, or .companion spirits, tobethesource oftheir power.
Shamans sometimes collect material objects which are
seen asphysical representations oftheir power
animals. While these material objects, which can
include rocks, plants, figurines, statues, works of
art, andmany other things besides, appear asnormal
physical objects intheobjective, material world,
thereal spirits residing within thepower objects
canactually beseen bytheshaman while under the

Artistic memetic magic iswithout qunat laR

have been drawing upon formillennia. Automatic!
drawings composed utilizing artistic memetic mugleal
techniques almost always result inthedepiction, In
artistic form, ofmythical beasts residing within
thesubconscious mind, power animals, orspirits.
Artistic memetic magic isamethod ofutilizing true
shamanic power toaccess the spiritual realm o
capture images ofthat realm inpictorial montages.
Inthis regards itadds tothetraditional shamanic
techniques, fornowshamans canuseartistic memetic
magic asasixth sense tolook into thespiritual
realm atanytime andcapture images ofwhat is
occurring within, without thenecessity ofbeing in
atrance state. Intheprocess ofcapturing images
ofthespiritual realm, aconduit isopened between
thn spirit realm and thematerial plane, whose
portal Ihthework ofartcreated.
.luat a«archaic nharnaiiM capture andmaintain a
collect Ionofpower animals tobocalled upon when
needed for supernatural power; artistic memetic
magicians summon andcollect spirits with each work
ofartthey create. Butwhile archaic shamans need
toenter atrance state through theuseofmind-
altering drugs, intense concentration, dancing, or
drumming inorder toseetheir spirits, theartistic
memetic magician canseehisorherspirits simply
bylooking attheartwork that hasbeen created.
Many shamans claim that their journeys into
theunderworld begin with adecent into ahole in
theEarth such asacave, serpent den, hollow tree
stump, oreven ariver. Thereader should examine
thepicture TheLovebetween Plants andAnimals. The
border which surrounds thespirits contained within
this picture isinfact ahollow tree stump, drawn
using artistic memetic magical techniques, before
theauthor had any knowledge ofthis aspect of
shamanic lore. Therefore, themagical picture The
Love between Plants andAnimals isclear evidence
that artistic memetic magic draws upon andutilizes
shamanic techniques toaccess theunderworld, orthe
unconscious mind, tocontact thespirits within.

Definition ofaMatrix
Inmagickal systems words areimbued with powerbecause they are symbolic re-presentations ofelements oftheuniverse. Speaking orwriting awordre-presents theelement which theword symbolizes.Without relation toaconscious mind, awritten word
isnothing more than acombination ofmeaninglessshapes. Themind, ormore precisely, thememeticprogramming residing within the mind, assignsparticular universal elements particular symbols,andfrom these symbols thepower oflanguage isderived. Therefore, theliteral definition oftheword matrix isonly relevant inrelation totheEnglish language system. This book teaches the
Momotic: Magical system. Therefore, the MemeticMagical definition oftheword-symbol matrix will bednf 1nod.
InMemo! 1cMagic, theword-symbol matrix isdefined asthegeometrical ormetaphysical shapewithin whose boundaries all elements ofthatparticular matrix must reside.
Shape issimply aconvenient term allowing thereader thepossibility offorming anabstract mentalimage ofamatrix; elements refer tothebasic unitscontained within and outofwhich amatrix is
constructed. Insimpler terms, amatrix isatotality including everything which itcontains.The universe, orthe whole collection ofexisting things, could therefore beproperly labeled
amatrix under Memetic Magical convention, ifanindividual were toattempt todefine anypart oftheuniverse, therefore dividing thetotality oftheuniverse matrix, each defined portion would beconsidered asub-matrix oftheuniverse matrix. Ifthat same sub-matrix were tobeconsidered onitsown, itwould simply beconsidered amatrix.

artifacts include roads, buildings, weapons, worksofart, computers, and vehicles. Any physical
objects notcreated byhuman beings butmanipulated

Languages
Languages themselves ate aillreel, product ofhuman culture andtherefore arecontained within thebounds oftheRSM. Ahuman cannot even communicatetoother members ofthespecies without doing sothrough themedium oftheRSM (except perhaps forvery rudimentary forms olcommunication based onbody language acquired through genetic inheritance).
Most ofwhat humanity haslabeled knowledge follows
asimilar process ofcreation anddistribution to
Manipulation oftheRoot Social Matrix&theFabric ofReality 20individual members ofthehuman species .Knowledge
iscreated through aninterplay ofsociocultural
forces; forinstance, ahuman maydiscover anew
fact through anovel combination ormodification ofknown facts. These known facts were already cultural
artifacts. Thehuman created anew fact throughmanipulation offacts already known bythecultural
system inquestion. Thus culture breeds moreculture. Facts (mental cultural artifacts) are
stored within theRSMformany years andtransmittedtoindividual humans through aninterface with the
RSM. Even thebuilding blocks outofwhich thoughts
areformed (which will bedescribed indetail inthenext chapter) arepart oftheRSM. Ahuman whohasnotlearned todeprogram himself cannot even think
consciously without doing sounder themalevolentguidance ofthepowerful influences oftheRSM.

Mmjlual Manipulation oftheSocial Matrixes
Th« tarms used toname the RSM and its
Inimmarabla branches aresimply tools used bythe
Individual torefer totheactual matrixes tobe
manipulated. They arevocabulary inthelanguage of
Ihehoc Ia Irmgician andtherefore nomore orless
real than theEnglish language terms being used on
thin page. Butthough thewords themselves have no
Inherent reality, what they symbolize isreal. Since
theRSM isareal element within theUniverse
Matrix, ittoocanbedivided. Anywhole canbe
divided into itsconstituent parts. Therefore, any
names chosen with which tolabel theparticular
«laments contained within the RSM will remain
off»c| Ivnno 1onqasthenaming remains consistent
amitrim nuinpr nlinrm Ionof Iheessence ofwhat has
bean labtslcn! laachieved. Once theparts oftheRSM
have been effect 1ve
1ydivided they can be
manipulated according tothepower andwill ofthe
Ind Iv Idun I.
Inconcrete terms, ttiefollowing Isanexample
ofhowandwhytheRSMcanbemanipulated:
Anindividual decides ItIsIllswill tobecome
wealthy and famous. Inorder todosohemust
position himself within theRSM nothat fame and
power flow tohim. Thus, hedecides tocast aspell
(put into effect asetofwilled actions) with the
intent oftransforming himself into anational
television talk show host. Ifhefashions the
correct spell (constructs aviable plan ofaction),
andcasts itwithout mistakes (takes those actions
which hehasplanned andexecutes them perfectly),hemust achieve theposition ofnational television
talk show host. With theattainment oftheposition
come thepower andwealth which hasbeen willed.
22But inorder tocast thespell correctly the
individual must negotiate andmanipulate thepowers
inherent intheRSM correctly. Hemust protect
himself from theattacks ofothers while attacking
/«r, v.
ionhisown. Hemust usethetools available within
theRSMtofashion reality Inaccordance with will.
Andmost importantly, anindividual must beable to
see the RSM, or itcannot bemanipulated
efficiently.
Seeing theRSM iswhat sets anindividual
apart from theprogrammed masses. Themasses are
ignorant oftheexistence andworkings oftheRSM.
Thus, themasses areblind. Themasses will forever
beatthe mercy ofthe elite, that is, of
individuals whocansee.
Theactions ofthemost powerful individuals
directly affect the lives ofevery human being
touched bytheparticular social sub-matrixes within
which those individuals work.
Doubt this tobetrue? Doubt thatyour life is
bn Itigd Iroot Iyntlooted bytheworkings ofpowerful
Individual Inwhoman Ipi ilute theRSM? Perhaps itwould
bewine torecall that every single business or
institution Insociety isthedirect result of
willed action inthesociocultural arena. Every time
aperson dines atarestaurant, drives acar,
purchases anitem, speaks aword, oreven usesmoney
itself, astrong case canbemade that their action
was atroot made possible byaspell cast byan
individual. Many sociocultural structures mayhave
been strongly affected byspontaneous fluctuations
ofthe RSM, butmany have not. Even among the
clearer cases ofspontaneous fluctuation oftheRSM,
ifthese fluctuations were tobetraced back far
enough totheir root, awillful action byan
individual manipulating the RSMwould likely be
discovered. Perhaps theindividual inquestion did
not speak the language ofMemetic Magic, but
nevertheless awillful manipulation oftheRSM (by
whatever name theindividual knew it)occurred.
Seeing theRoot Social Matrix
Only afraction oftheRSM canbedirect ly
detected bysensory evidence alone. Those parts
susceptible torevelation through sensor yd.dahave
Memetic Magic Manipulation oftheRoot Social Matrix&theFabric ofReality 23


already been named bytheuninitiated. Buteven in
thecase ofportions oftheRSMdetected bythe
masses through sensory observation, naming does not
necessarily imply understanding. Allofthewords
referring tophysical objects inhuman languages
refer tophysical cultural artifacts detected
through sensory observation. Some of Ihetraditional
sciences, including sociology, anthropology,
archeology, andpsychology, probe into theunseen
portions oftheRSM, butthese sciences have only
just begun toisolate elements oftheunseen RSM.
Therecent discovery oftheexistence ofmemes may
revolutionize thesocial sciences inthenottoo
distant future, leading scientists todiscover the
RSM, butuntil that daycomes, thestudy oftheRSM
will remain occult territory. Even when hidden
facets oftheRSMareuncovered thestructures of
the sciences themselves tend torepress these
discoveries since they donot fit within the
particular scientific and socially acceptable
framework oftheage.
Nevertheless, proofs oftheexistence ofthe
RSMcanactually beseen. Aritual hasbeen included
inthis work which hasthepower toopen theeyes .
The best and perhaps only way for an
individual totruly come toanunderstanding ofthe
RSMistoseeitwith their owneyes. Butitshould
benoted that theRSMwill appear differently to
each individual according tothe framework, or
sociocultural angle, from which one looks. Itis
only through thelens ofourculturally manufactured
sociocultural conscious that theRSMcanbeseen, as
theRSM isthe totality ofhuman sociocultural
experience andcreation. TheRSMcanonly appear to
theindividual insymbols which arecompatible with
theframework ofthepersonal mind. Thus, theRSM
will never appear exactly the same toany two
individuals.
Illusion Concealing theRoot Social Matrix
Every human being possesses the tools
necessary toseetheRSM. ButtheRSM isseen only
byanelite minority. Farless than 1percent ofthe
total human population isable toconsistently s<*t>

Manipulation oftheRoot Social Matrix&theFabric ofReality 24aromany whocannot even clearly seeall ofthe
physical aspects oftheRSM. Perhaps onehuman in
tonthousand hasfreed their mind sufficiently ofat
loaat thefirst layer ofillusion concealing the
RHM, andonehuman infifty orahundred thousand
haaboth freed themind sufficiently ofillusion to
aeetheRSMandhasalso learned howtoeffectively
manipulate theRSM tocause change inaccordance
with will.
The illusions concealing the RSM arevery
strong. They maybe-oftwotypes: created illusion
and spontaneous illusion .Inmost cases the two
varieties ofillusion overlap.
Spontaneous Illusion
Spontaneous illusions areillusions created by
theconstant flux oftheRSM. Since theform ofthe
RSMisconstantly fluctuating associocultural ideas
andcreations areborn orpass outofthematrix,
theRSM iseffectively concealed from human beings
duetoitsvery nature. Itnever solidifies into a
single recognizable form. Human beings arevery
reluctant toallow reality toelements ofthe
universe which donotassume arelatively singular
form. TheRSMappears different today than itdid
yesterday, and itwill appear different again
tomorrow. Thesheer size oftheRSM, combined with
its fluctuating nature effectively conceals its
existence from thevastmajority ofhuman beings.
The RSM consists ofall individuals who
together constitute collective human society and
culture. Anyaction taken byanyindividual, any
words spolcen, oranychanges made tosociocultural
artifacts will transform thestructure oftheRSM,
provided that theindividual acts within asetting
which may atsome time come totheattention of
another individual. Billions ofsuch transformations
occur every moment ontheEarth. Therefore, itis
very difficult fortheRSMtobefrozen andseen for
what itis.
Created Illusion
Spontaneously created illusion caused by
fluctuations oftheRSMcombines with astaggering
density ofconsciously andunconsciously created
Memetic Magic 25


illusion toform anearly impenetrable illusionary
shield concealing the true forms ofhuman
sociocultural systems.
Created illusions are formed consciously or
unconsciously bypeople andinstitutions toconceal
andprotect true forms andactions. Such illusions
areinexorably intertwined with themaintenance of
power andstatus.
Even theuninitiated ignorant masses ofthe
world aremasters oftheartofunconscious illusion
creation, though they only create theillusions they
dobecause their mental framework allows them toact
innoother way. Themasses have been programmed to
create and enforce illusion. The illusions they
create invariably protect anelite fewwhohold
positions ofpower.
Language oftheRoot Social Matrix
Anindividual canread thelanguage oftheRSM
only through thelens ofthepersonal consciousness.
Thehuman consciousness communicates with theego
through symbolic thought. Thebasic unit ofsymbolic
thought isthememe. Thus theRSMcanonly beread
(seen) through complex memetic structures, or
symbols. Anunderstanding ofmemes andmemetics is
essential iftheRSMistobeseen andmanipulated.
Manipulation oftheRoot Social Matrix&theFabric ofReality 26Scientific Memetics
The past twenty years have witnessed the
ascension ofanunprecedented offshoot ofthesocial
sciences designated bythe name memetic theory.
Memetic theory isgathering positive momentum within
scientific circles. Memetic studies are being
undertaken which possess thevery real potential of
resulting inafuture paradigm shift intheway
scientists view how the world, and more
particularly, ideas within theworld, operate. Some
scientists believe memetics will have asprofound an
effect onsociocultural theory asDarwinism hadon
theories ofbiological evolution. Memetic theory
holds tremendous potential toexplain exactly how
ideas areformed, maintained, andreplicated within
sociocultural systems. Such knowledge would beof
inestimable aidtomagickal practice. What isthis
newscience ofthememo andhowdoes itrelate to
theRoot Social Matrix andthemagickal arts?
Memetics :
Thestudy ofmemes.
Memetic Magickal Definition ofMemes
1)Ameme isthesociocultural language which
writes theprograms producing theframework ofthe
mind, orthe consciousness. 2)Ameme isthe
equivalent ofamental atom; the internal re-
presentation ofknowledge. 3)Ameme isthebasic
unit ofsociocultural transmission, which strives to
replicate itself whenever possible.
Memetic Chemistry
Inthe same manner atoms combine toform
chemical structures, memes combine toform complex
ideas.
TheIdeosphere
Scientists have coined aterm which adequately
describes animportant portion oftheRoot Social
Matrix. They call theenvironment inwhich ideas are
Memetic Magic 27


passed andmaintained theideosphere.
Memes arethe
basic unit, oratom, ofwhich theelements residing
intheideosphere areformed. Coherent thoughts and
ideas are theresult ofaccumulations ofmemes.
Memes combine with other memes toform idea-
molecules. These idea-molecules can then combine
further tocreate full-fledged memetic structures,
uptoandincluding themost complex myths, abstract
ideas, religious systems, andlanguages.
Thehuman mind acts asamachine capable of
accepting, storing, rearranging, transforming, and
reordering memes. Inaddition, themind isvery
capable oftransmitting memes to, and receiving
memes from, the ideosphere, with orwithout
conscious intent.
Memetic Chemistry
Meme Atoms
Meme atoms areindividual units ofsymbolic
thought. Meme atoms constitute thefabric ofwhich
memetic molecules arewoven andout ofwhich the
ideosphere isformed.
Meme Molecules
Meme molecules arecombinations ofmeme atoms.
Since meme atoms areindividual units ofthought,
meme molecules arecomplex ideas (consisting ofmore
than asingle symbolic thought).
Inchemistry, molecules areconglomerations of
chemical elements which bind together toform
larger, more complex structures. InMemetic Magic,
meme molecules arecombinations ofindividual memes
which bind together toform more complex ideas. An
excellent example ofameme molecule would bethe
italicized word inparenthesis attheendofthis
sentence (tree) .Theword tree isactually composed
offour separate letters, the t,r,e,and e.Each
oftheindividual letters intheword aredistinct
symbolic elements within the English language
system. Therefore, these letters are properly
labeled memetic atoms. When theindividual letters
t,r,e,andebind together they form theword tree
andsymbolize amore complex idea than thesumof
theoriginal parts. That is,theconcept tree ismuch more complex than thecombined concepts ofthe
letters t, r,e,and e.Thus, anyword inthe
English language isamemetic molecule.
Any complex concept isamemetic molecule
which can bebroken down, ordiluted,
into its
individual elements. For instance, the concept
school isamemetic molecule which canbediluted if
desired. Acorrect Mcmctlc Chemistry formula
describing thedilution oftheconcept school would
read:
School =1stGrade +2'"1Grade +3rdGrade +4th
Grade +etc.
Each oftheindividual elements extracted from
theconcept school could then bediluted initsown
right.
2ndGrade =Mrs. Greenleaf +King Elementary
School +Room 109+etc.
Ifdesired, memetic molecules could be
portrayed visually inthesame manner aschemical
molecules arepresented.
Social Contamination &Purification
Asocially contaminated thought isanythought
affected toanydegree bytheRoot Social Matrix. In
practical, though notabsolute terms, allconscious
thought issocially affected. Anyaction taken as
the result ofsocially contaminated thought is
controlled to agreater orlesser degree by
sociocultural forces. Thus, noactions which are
socially contaminated canbeconsidered truly free
actions. Absolute freedom inthought and action,
willed self determination, isonly possible outside
ofsociocultural influence.
Inpractice itisnearly impossible forany
human ever exposed tohuman society orculture to
consciously deliberate without being influenced to
some degree bysociocultural forces. Conscious
thought sterilized from thecontamination ofall
sociocultural influence iscalled purified thought.
Theoretically, complete isolation from sociocultural
influence would allow 100% purified thought to
emerge spontaneously within theconscious mind. But
achieving such astate ofcomplete sociocultural
isolation isextremely difficult. Therefore, in
order tocreate purified thought itisoften
Manipulation oftheRoot Social Matrix&theFabric ofReality 28Memetic Magic 29


necessary toisolate acontaminated unit ofthought
(complex memetic structure ormeme molecule) and
remove those parts ofthe thought which can be
ascertained tobesocially contaminated. Removal or
extraction ofcontaminated portion.*) ofmemes isa
deliberate, conscious process wh 1chcan bevery
difficult. Most contaminated thought awhich slip
through our mental defenses donobecause our
conscious mind cannot recogri Iy.u theparticular
contaminating element forwhat iL I;i.
Itshould benoted, however, that social
contamination isnot always negul Ive. Social
contamination canserve tohelp, hurt, orhave no
affect whatsoever onanindividual depending on
particular sociocultural circumstance,*) andthekind
ofactions created bythethought Inguest Ion.
Though completely puril ledthought israrely
possible, itisvery possible toobtain thought
which has been purified toahigh degree from
negative contaminating sociocultural influence. The
higher thepercentage offree thought, themore
capable anindividual would beofcausing willed
change inhisorherenvironment.
TheMemetic Magician, like thechemist, always
attempts topurify his final product. When an
individual extracts ameme from, orbinds ameme
into, theRoot Social Matrix thegoal isalways 100%
purity from contaminating sociocultural influence,
both measurable and immeasurable. Measurable
contamination isfairly easy toextract, while
unseen influences aremuch more difficult toremove
from thefinal product.
Sociocultural purity isoneoftheessential
goals ofMemetic Magic. Though it isnot
realistically possible toattain 100% purity from
RSMcontamination, alevel ofpurity canbeachieved
which ishigh enough toallow self-willed action, as
opposed tothesocially— willed action ofthemasses.
Anindividual sets themselves apart from the
programming andsociocultural conditioning ofthe
masses inorder that theRSMmay beeffectively
manipulated without theincurrence ofthenegative
influences ofretro-manipulation bred from contact
with sociocultural constructs .
Manipulation oftheRoot Social Matrix&theFabric ofReality 30Unfortunately, retro-manipulation is
unavoidable whenever anattempt ismade to
manipulate the Root Social Matrix. This retro-
manipulation will necessarily not beconsciously
noted bytheindividual atthetime oftheworking,
foranyretro-manipulating forces willpenetrate the
psyche through holes inmental defenses.
Sociocultural workings should always contain
potent purification measures .Theindividual should
always bewary and overly protective against
unwanted memetic programming contaminating themind
during contact with theRSM. Itthenature ofthe
RSMtoattempt toprogram anymind with which it
comes into contact, but this programming can be
consciously andwillfully repelled sothat only a
small percentage oftheretro-programming breaks
through themagician's defenses.
Memo Genesis (Spontaneous andFashioned)
Spoilt ,il)ootin Momotlc Gtuios hi
Spoilt ,inru his nioniet Irgenesis isthecreation of
new memos 1tom the substance ofthe ideosphere
devoid ofwilled intent. Newmemes areconstantly
being produced within thefluctuating matrix ofthe
ideosphere, resulting from the recombination,
transformation, evolution, addition, orsubtraction
ofexisting memes.
Spontaneous memetic genesis isthe force
ultimately responsible for the majority of
sociocultural structures inherent inhuman society.
Large institutions cannot grow sufficiently to
attain extended size without utilizing themechanism
ofspontaneous memetic genesis.
Take afictional multinational corporation,
for example. This hypothetical corporation was
founded byasingle manasawilled andpurposeful
creation through themanipulation ofmemes inthe
ideosphere tocreate acomplex memetic structure
defining the corporation's form. This
>corporatiorK- memetic structure wasthen inserted
into theproper location within theRoot Social
Matrix. Once inserted into theRSMthecorporation
grew, orexpanded, within theRSM inanearly
automated manner due toamechanical process of
Memetic Magic 31


I
jspontaneous memetic genesis.
Thus, though the
hypothetical corporation wasinitiated byfashioned
j. (consciously planned) memetic genesis itwas
maintained and expanded through spontaneous
i| (automated) memetic genesis.
The corporation itself never could have
i expanded andsolidified itsposition within theRSM
without the mechanism ofspontaneous memetic
1 genesis. Noone man iscapable ofdirectly
Icontrolling allofthefacets ofamultinational
corporation and its 50,000+ employees atonce,
jMemetic structures must becreated which program the
actions ofthese employees toact within the
i; boundaries setbythecorporate sociocultural system
Iinquestion.
Thefounder ofthecorporation could notmake
50,000 individual decisions perminute, norcould he
possibly hope tocommunicate hisdecisions back to
hisemployees even ifhewasable tomake such an
extraordinary number ofdecisions. Theemployees
must rely onthe particular brand ofmemetic
programming they have inherited within the;corporate
structure and decide which oftheir potential
actions stay within the bounds ofacceptable
behavior and which do not. These mislabeled
individual decisions are not really individual
decisions atall; they areindividual decisions made
within arange ofpredetermined options. Soina
very real sense theemployees ofthe fictitious
corporation will appear tobemaking individual
decisions when inreality they are following a
specific, though variable tosome degree, course of
action outlined bythefounder ofthecorporation.
These mechanistic individual decisions and acts
taken bythe employees ofthe corporation are
examples ofspontaneous memetic genesis,though
these spontaneous events have been given boundaries
jbyanoriginal fashioned genesis.
(| So,while anindividual has thepower to
Icreate awilled memetic genesis within theRSM, this
I willed genesis must acttocreate memetic structures
! which will serve todirect spontaneous memetic
jgenesis toward amechanistic creation and

I ideosphere will control theactions ofhuman beings.
Manipulation oftheRoot Social Matrix&theFabric ofReality 32andthese actions will beredistributed into the
Root Social Matrix. Insimpler terms, anindividual
canaffect change insociety simply bycreating
thought viruses which serve toinfect, teach, and
replicate desires throughout apopulation. Since
thought leads toaction, thought control will lead
toconcrete physical control. Asanindividual is
incapable ofbeing everywhere atonce, they must
rely onothers programmed toactforthem ifthey
aretoachieve large-scale change within society.
Fashioned Memetic Genesis
Any willful manipulation ofthe ideosphere
which results inthecreation ofanewmemetic
structure isanexample offashioned memetic
genesis. Individuals canskillfully engineer memetic
structures todownload into theideosphere with the
intent ofcausing willed change. Whether these
changes actualize depends onwhether thecorrect
mnmetlc structure has been downloaded into the
correct location IntheIdeosphere.
Forexample, anindividual may decide, for
whatever reason, that henolonger wishes foranyof
his associates toconsume alcohol. Inorder to
achieve this end, hecould fashion an->only stupid
people drink alcohoK- memetic structure. The
memetic structure, ifsuccessfully transmitted,
maintained, and reproduced among the target
population, will serve tokeep the individual's
associates from consuming alcohol, fornone ofthem
wish tobelabeled stupid.
Whether the memetic structure has any
objective truth ornotisonly important inregards
tohow readily itisaccepted bythe target
population. Ifthetarget population isintelligent
enough toperceive theobjective truth ofagiven
matter (inmost cases they are not),and ifthey
then arethetype inclined toresist memes which do
notcorrespond toobjective truth (again most are
notoverly concerned with theobjective trgth ofa
matter),then fashioning amemetic structure whose
truth isnotgrounded inobjective reality isbound
tofail, andpossibly backfire.
Fashioning amemetic structure is not
necessarily aseasy amatter asitmayseem, though
Memetic Magic 33


insome cases itisaneasy matter. Many factors,
both seen and unseen, must betaken under
consideration when calculating Ilieodds ofsuccess
orfailure foragiven fashioned monteticstructure.
The man ofthe masses inable tocreate
fashioned memetic structures anddownload them into
theideosphere, following thesame general rules
discussed above. These fashioned memon ofthemasses
are very prevalent. The memetic structures and
thought viruses (the mental programming and
sociocultural conditioning) which lorm theframework
andcontents ofthemind oftheman olthemasses
areconstantly being downloaded into IlieIdeosphere
astheextremely powerful ideal typn (anideal type
isadominant memetic structure) thought viruses
seek toreplicate themselves into uninfected minds.
Butthese so-called fashioned merries o(themasses
could bemore correctly labeled spontaneous memes,
forthough thecreator consciously thinks awillful
andoriginal memetic structure isbeing produced,
thecreator's actual conscious mind isnotreally
their own. Themanofthemasses thinks thethoughts
ofothers because hehasbeen programmed todoso,
thus hemistakenly believes thememetic structures
hecreates aretheresult ofhisownconsiderations.
Only when amind hasbeen purified toahigh
degree from theprogrammat ica 1influences oltheRSM
can any memetic structure ofwillful creation
correctly belabeled fashioned.
Where amanofthe
masses fashions hismemes according towhat, hehas
been programmed tosee, the individual fashions
memes seeing allthat themanofthemasses cansee,
and all that hecannot aswell. Anindividual
operates with anunderstanding ofthe entire
sociocultural system while amanofthemasses works
within preprogrammed boundaries.
There areseveral types offashioned memes.
Thefollowing categories aredefined only toallow
thereader abetter understanding ofthetopic at
hand, though itisimportant tonote that many
memetic structures will fall into thegray zone
between categories.
34Attack Memes
Attack memes arememes fashioned toattack
individuals orportions oftheRSM. Attack memes areextremely prevalent. Ifanindividual hasanysocial
relations they will likely bethetarget ofnumerous
attack memes onadaily basis. Themost powerful
attack memes are usually thought viruses which
attack anydeviation from prescribed methods ofaction. Such attack memes play avital role inforcing conformity within social systems.
For instance, ifPerson Ahad asexual
relationship with Person Bwhowasunder thecontrol
ofa
->reproduction isthemost important element in
life<-
memetic structure, and Person Acasually
suggested tohismate that henever wished tohave

->reproduction isthemost important element in

memetic structure isanaggressive thought
virus which attempts tosubdue threats inthemost
effective manner available within thedynamics ofagiven situation. Theparticular attack meme Person B
chooses toutilize will depend onthesituation asseen through thememetic eyes ofthe —>
reproduction

IfPerson Aisinthepresence ofalarge
group ofpeople, theattack meme activated will
likely befashioned toward lowering theoffender's
status intheeyes oftheother people present. This
lowers thepossibility theoffender's offense might
beobserved andcopied. Thus, such anattack wouldlikely take theform ofastatus strike orinsult,
anexample ofwhich might be:
Attack Meme =->anyone whodoes not wish tohave children isnot arealman<-
This attack plays on another socially
prevalent meme which attempts todefine what aman

In, rtrirlwhy Ittssupposedly Advantageous tobe
Inlmlcsd n'man'. Itisanattack tailored both for
Itinorrondor andthebystandm n.Here isanother

I)r»unfit tmotive towomen<-
or IImmore complex:
->anyone whodoesn't wish tohave children must
tmunattractive towomen and thotntoto Lsnot areal

Theeffectiveness ofsuch attacks will vary
depending onthememetic structures present within
theminds ofthose whoare therecipients ofthe
attacks. Iftheoffender and all ofthebystanders
areruled bythe
~>children areunnecessary drainers ofwealth<-
memetic structure, theattack launched would likely
beatotal failure andreflect negatively back upon
itscreator.
Theideosphere and itsmanifestations within
theRSMisabattleground wherein aceaseless waris
waged between countless memes .Thestrongest ofthe
memes have established themselves intheminds ofa
majority ofthepeople. Theuniform action caused by
these dominant memes among their infected hosts is
what makes uslabel thegreater number ofpeople in
allsociety themasses.
Ifany single memetic stmeture was ever
successful invanquishing all olitsopponents, the
human race would achieve true and complete
unification. Whether such aunification represents a
heaven orhell onEarth depends entirely upon
personal viewpoint.
Defensive Memes
Defensive memes arememes created toblock or
divert theactions ofattacking memes. Since the
ideosphere isaceaseless warzone, theindividual
will beunder constant attack bymemes which donot
approve ofparticular behavior patterns. Often itis
necessary toblock theactions ofassaulting memes
inorder tosuccessfully activate fashioned memes.
36Protection
Forinstance, ifaperson under thecontrol of
the ->short hair isuncool<- memetic structure
attacks anindividual with abuzz cut, the
individual could create adefensive meme such as->I
only wear myhair short because Iexercise
constantly andifIhadlong hair Iwould betoo
hot<- for protection purposes. This memetic
structure attempts todeceive theattacking meme
into ceasing the attack due toblunting the
perceived threat.
Concealment
Very often itisnecessary tocreate amemetic
structure for thepurpose ofconcealing another
memetic structure tooweak towithstand adirect
attack. Certain memes bind better todominant
memntI
rstructures than others.
Hemet toMutation
When telnaand Into theRDM, memetic structures
take on alire oftheir own. Theindividual can
engineer memnt ie structures with certain
characteristics intended toprotect acreation from
neon andunforeseen memetic influence, butwill have
little control over how afashioned memetic
structure reacts once ithasbeen downloaded into
theRSM. Iftheindividual engineers ahigh quality
memetic structure, itshould withstand theattacks
ofpre-existing memes andaccomplish thegoal itwas
created toaccomplish. Ifthe individual leaves a
weakness within amemetic structure itcould be
exploited bypre-existing memes residing within the
ideosphere. Unforeseen memes linking tofashioned
memetic structures cancause those structures to
mutate into newmemetic structures which then affect
theRSMinunanticipated ways.
Memetic structures, like atoms, bind to
receptive points atthe edges ofother memetic
structures. Ifanindividual wishes tocreate a
memetic structure unlikely tomutate, they must make
certain toengineer amemetic structure with asfew
receptive points aspossible. Though intheory it
might bepossible tofashion amemetic structure
without anyreceptive points, inpractice itisnot.
Memetic Magic Manipulation oftheRoot Social Matrix&theFabric ofReality37


Memetic structures become memetic structures
precisely because the individual memes which
constitute theparts ofthewhole areable tobind
tooneanother. Therefore, itappears tobeinthe
nature ofmemes tobind with other memes tocreate
more complex thought entities. Though anindividual
maybeable toengineer amemetic structure with no
open binding points, these closed binding points
will still besubject toerosion ,extraction, and
attack byforeign memetic structures. Inclearer
terms, though anindividual can create memetic
structures shielded from theinfluence offoreign
memetic structures, this shielding canalways be
bypassed byaninvading memetic structure possessing
theproper attributes.
Fashioned memetic structures with strong
defensive walls should beable towithstand foreign
memetic attack over long periods oftime, remaining
true totheintent ofthememetic engineer. But
given enough time, foreign memetic structures will
eventually evolve into forms capable ofsuccessfully
invading even thestrongest ofthecurrent memetic
structures.
Anindividual need notnecessarily engineer
hismemetic structures with strong walls atthe
binding points. Another approach could betaken.
Memetic structures could befashioned with aneye
toward attracting other memes and incorporating
those memes into theoriginal structure. Askilled
memetic engineer could create amemetic framework
with open binding ports into which other memetic
structures would beabsorbed. Thefashioning ofan
absorption/adaptation memetic structure isarisky
butworkable plan. Though theexact form ofthe
final product maynotbepredictable, itseffects
within theRSM can beestimated within general
bounds.
THOUGHT VIRUSES
Theideosphere portion oftheRSMiscomposed
ofatleast two distinct varieties ofmemetic
structures: singular andreplicating structures.
Singular memetic structures arethose memetic
structures which donot, for whatever reason,
replicate. Replication ofmemetic structures is
Manipulation oftheRoot Social Matrix&theFabric ofReality 38analogous to the reproduction ofbiological
organisms. Inorder for amemetic structure to
replicate itmust bind toanother memetic structure
andmate orcopy itself therein.
Onevery prevalent arena forthereplication
ofmemetic structures isthehuman mind. Thehuman
mind itself contains amemetic structure ofgreat
complexity. Memetic structures constantly invade the
human consciousness andseek toreplicate therein.
Thereasons for the lack ofreplication of
singular memetic structures arenumerous. First, a
memetic structure may contain noreproductive
element; that is, noportion ofthe memetic
structure contains replication instructions which
can bepassed ontoother memetic structures.
Likewise, asingular memetic structure maycontain
mechanisms forreplication, butthese mechanisms may
notbeable, forwhatever reason, toperform their
functions. Amemetic structure which fails to
replicate isdoomed toperish with thepassing of
themore complex memetic structure inwhich itis
contained. Every human mind contains numerous
singular memetic structures which will pass forever
outoftheRSMwith thepassing ofthehuman host
(orsooner ifthesingular memetic structure is
modified ordestroyed byamore fitstructure).
Itisimportant tounderstand that thememetic
structures which come todominate theRSM doso
because they arethemost successful, ormost fit,
'atreplication. Fitness inregards toreplication
does notnecessarily correspond with anyinherent
goodness orpower toleadhumanity toahigher order
ofexistence. Infact, theopposite isoften true.
Most ofthememetic structures with real potential
tohelp anindividual are singular memetic
structures which arenotfitreplicators. Forevery
onememetic structure which replicates efficiently,
there arefifty thousand ormore that donot. Of
these fifty thousand memetic structures which
replicate poorly ornotatall, there arebound to
beafewwith real potential tohelp theindividual
accomplish particular goals. Inaddition, themost
fitmemetic structures tend bytheir nature tobe
themost prevalent. Thus ingaining orutilizing a
fit memetic structure anindividual isonly
Memetic Magic 39


acquiring orusing something that most menalready
have. Real power lies inknowing things orhaving
abilities other people donothave.
Agreat mistake oftheuninitiated isto
equate successful replication with essential
goodness. Successfully replicating memetic
structures (thebeliefs ofthemasses) forthemost
part possess the power toreplicate well and
therefore unify human belief; nomore, noless. To
repeat, thestrongest power inherent inmost belief
systems (complex memetic structures) isthepower to
unify great numbers ofpeople through the
unification oftheir beliefs. Unification ofbelief
equates tounification ofaction. Nations and
religions are formed on memetic structures
possessing extraordinarily strong and efficient
replication mechanisms.
Though some successful replicating memetic
structures may contain great inherent truth and
power, most donot. Tobelieve something must be
true andsacred simply because most people believe
ittobetrue andsacred isusually amistake. Most
people believe most ofwhat they believe because
that belief hassuccessfully replicated within their
mind.
The key tocreating spectacular widespread
willed change inthe RSM isthe creation or
discovery ofappropriate and powerful memetic
structures towhich anindividual purposefully binds
successful replication mechanisms. Alternatively,
theopposite tact could befollowed whereby aproven
replication structure istaken and bound to a
powerful andmeaningful unfertile structure.
Ifanindividual wishes tomake afundamental
alteration intheRSM, that change would have tobe
effected bylarge numbers ofpeople. Thus, the
individual might attempt tobind his fashioned
memetic structure onto anexisting structure which
has already proven extraordinarily effective.
Memetic structures which have proven tobe
extraordinarily effective caneasily bediscovered
within society. Some examples of such
extraordinarily effective structures are large
religions, corporations, educational institutions,
television shows, movies, andpolitical systems. If
Manipulation oftheRoot Social Matrix&theFabric ofReality 40afashioned memetic structure issuccessfully
implanted into an effective existing
institutionalized structure itwill stand an
excellent chance ofaffecting large numbers of
people.
Though anexcellent plan intheory, in
practice itisvery difficult tofashion anddeliver
amemetic structure which will effectively bind to
anymajor dominant memetic structure. Thedominant
memetic structures ruling theminds ofthemasses
achieved their dominance through successful
resistance against theadvances ofcountless foreign
memetic structures, and intheprocess evolved to
become super-effective atrepulsing memetic attack.
Therefore itishighly unlikely (though still
possible) foranyfashioned memetic structure to
successfully infiltrate the dominant memetic
structures ofthe age. Any invading memetic
structures will besubject tothedominant memetic
structure's strong defenses. Iftheinvading memetic
structure somehow manages tobypass the outer
defenses of adominant memetic structure, the
dominant memetic structure will then attempt to
absorb theinvading meme into itsownstructure, in
such awaythat thedominant memetic structure makes
useoftheinvader andnottheother wayaround. Any
invading meme must successfully defeat orbypass
both ofthese layers ofdefense inorder tobind to
the dominant meme inamanner advantageous to
itself.
All successfully replicating memetic
structures cancorrectly belabeled thought viruses.
Memetic structures canonly replicate byinvading*
andmanipulating other memetic structures. Thoughts
cannot reproduce except inthe human mind; though
they can and often do lead to physical
manifestations (this book isanexample) .These
physical manifestations can only replicate the
original thought virus upon contact with ahuman
consciousness.
Characteristics ofaVirus
Where pathogenic and inert viruses play a
large role inthebiological sphere, thought viruses
command aneven more prevalent role inthesocial
Memetic Magic 41


sphere. Inorder foranidea (amemetic structure)
tooutlive itsparent host, itmust replicate (or
reproduce) into themind ofanother, orinto a
physical structure capable ofabsorbing and re-
projecting theessence oftheidea atafuture date.
Writing, film, andaudio CDsare just afewofthe
physical manifestations capable ofabsorbing andre-
projecting memetic structures.
Inorder toreproduce, allmemo IIt:structures
follow theexample ofthebiological virus; they
must penetrate, instruct, andreplicate.
Penetration
All memetic structures possess defensive
characteristics, whether these becomplex defensive
systems orsimple receptors which only allow select
memetic structures ofcertain configurations to
bind. Amemetic structure seeking toreproduce must
find away topenetrate thedefenses ofatarget
memetic structure. Ifamemetic structure is
successful inpenetrating thedefenses ofatarget
structure, the successful memetic structure will
bind onto itsnew host. Inareal sense thehost
structure hasincorporated theattacking structure
into itsform. Assuch, there ceases tobeahost
structure andanattacking structure; what remains
issimply amore complex structure. But ifan
attacking structure destroys orremoves portions of
theoriginal structure what remains isamemetic
structure notnecessarily more complex, but ofa
different form (anewarrangement ofindividual
memes).
Penetration canbeaccomplished inmany ways.
When anattacking memetic structure finds a
receptive host (that is, amemetic structure whose
binding points areconducive tothespecific type or
form ofstructure which isattacking) penetration is
often simply amatter oflatching onto thecorrect
binding points. For example, a->tigers are
dangerous<- memetic structure istailor made to
accept an->aperson should notgowalking through
thejungle alone<- memetic structure. Aperson who
holds a->tigers aredangerous<- memetic structure
need only come incontact with theidea that he
should notwalk through thejungle alone tobind
42this newmemetic structure tothepreexisting one
stored inhis mind. Inthis case the invading
memetic structure will inall likelihood be
assimilated without resistance.
Butpenetration need not besuch asimple
matter. Human minds areonly programmed toaccept
memetic structures within certain boundaries. For
instance, ahuman mind dominated bythe->Imust
reproduce<- memetic structure will very likely
reject aninvading ->Ishould spend mylife in
complete isolations memetic structure. Ifthe
target were tospend hislife incomplete isolation,
hewould have noopportunities tointeract with
members ofthe opposite sex and therefore no
opportunities tomate. Without mating there canbe
noreproduction (barring scientific solutions) .In
order for this hypothetical ->I must live in
complete isolation<- memetic structure to
successfully penetrate thetarget mind itmust find
away tobypass, destroy, orerode thetarget's
memetic defenses.
Simple repetition over along enough period of
time will sometimes lead tosuccessful penetration.
Atarget mind will beunder constant attack from
other memetic structures, some ofwhich will be
successful. These successfully penetrating memetic
structures will proceed totransform theframework
ofthetarget mind tovarying degrees. Ifamemetic
attack iscontinued over along enough period of
time, theattacking memetic structure might beable
tofind apassing crack inatarget mental structure
formed byanother invading memetic structure.
Memetic Packets
Sometimes memetic structures which areunable
topenetrate atarget mind can beattached to
stronger memetic structures inasort ofpackage
deal. Ifatarget mind needs toaccept acertain
memetic structure itwill take that structure along
with any unwanted baggage attached toit. For
instance, abald woman with adesperate need tobe
socially accepted might accept a->bald women are
rare and therefore uniquely beautifuK- memetic
structure even ifattached tothis meme wasanother
->bald women should live inisolation toshow the
Memetic Magic Manipulation oftheRoot Social Matrix&theFabric ofReality 43


world they aretruly unique andabove it<- memetic
structure. This ofcourse isanoverly simple
example aidmany more factors canandoften dogo
into theacceptance ofanymemetic packet.
Oftentimes invading memetic structures will be
socomplex that they contain numerous needed
elements packaged along with twice asmany
undesirable elements.
Many times atarget isable tointegrate
needed portions of memetic structure while
discarding the rest. Sometimes theentire package
will beaccepted with the undesirable elements
discarded over time.
Brainwashing
Asufficiently strong memetic attack utilizing
appropriate tactics can break down any memetic
structure. When such attacks are successfully
applied towards human minds theprocess iscalled
brainwashing.
Brainwashers areprogrammers ofhuman minds.
Brainwashers force their victims into situations
wherein asmany aspects oftheRSMarecontrolled as
possible. Those whoarebrainwashed arefirst forced
into situations where allsociocultural influences
arecontrolled andmodified bythebrainwasher so
that these sociocultural influences will work to
break down their entire complex memetic structure
(conscious mind) .Once thecontents ofamind have
been erased they canbereplaced with anycomplex
memetic structure abrainwasher might desire to
implant. Ifthe operation issuccessful, the
brainwasher will have programmed another mind todo
their bidding.
The brainwasher actually creates anew
sociocultural sub-matrix isolated from thelarger
dominant sociocultural matrix oftheoutside world.
Into thismatrix ofhisowncreation thebrainwasher
brings subjects, willing orunwilling asthey may
be. Inorder forthebrainwashing procedure tobe
effective the subjects must bekept within the
isolated sub-matrix long enough fortheir mental
defenses tobreak down. Therefore, aneffect, ive
brainwasher never allows subjects towithdraw fromthesociocultural sub-matrix ofhiscreation until
such atime asthebrainwashing iscomplete.
Contrary topopular belief, brainwashers need
notbeindividuals. Anything which hastheability
tocreate anisolate sociocultural sub-matrix can
brainwash those whofall within theisolated zone.
Groups ofhumans, schools, churches, movies, books,
sports teams, andeven nations cancreate isolate
sociocultural sub-matrixes within theRSM.
Brainwashing isapowerful tool which can
serve good orevil purposes. Individuals areable to
practice forms ofself-brainwashing allowing major
alterations intheir psychic structures; ineffect
re-programming themselves. Major change inthought
correlates with fundamental alteration ofaction.
TheOftheOpening oftheEyes ritual near theend
ofthis book bases much ofitspower onself-
brainwashing principals.
Instruction (Programming)
Once athought virus has successfully
penetrated thedefensive structures ofanewhost it
maythen attempt toinstruct orprogram that host.
Without such programming memetic structures have a
difficult time replicating. Without instructions of
itsown anewly attached segment ofalarger memetic
structure would have torely onthelarger structure
attempting topass onthenewly acquired part for
reasons ofitsown.
Athought virus whose intent iseffective
replication will attempt toprogram whatever
structure it has penetrated. Ideally, this
programming will instruct thehost structure tomake
more copies oftheoriginal thought virus andsend
those copies out into the ideosphere. Inmore
practical terms an->eat peppermint icecream<-
memetic structure will infect amind, program that
mind toeatmore peppermint icecream, andreplicate
byinducing thehost toproclaim toother people
just howtasty peppermint icecream is.
Athought virus mayprogram amind todomore
than just seek uninfected minds and attempt to
replicate the thought virus structure within.
Thought viruses canattempt toprogram amind to
think whatever thethought virus wants themind to
Manipulation oftheRoot Social Matrix&theFabric ofReality 44 Memetic Magic 45


think. Often these extraneous actions serve to
maneuver thehost into aposition where replication
canbeattempted.
Theoretically, aperfectly engineered thought
virus could make its host do anything. By
controlling thoughts, physical actions are
controlled. Butunless anindividual hasaccess to
anexact blueprint ofevery portion, both conscious
andunconscious, ofapotential host's mind, hewill
notbeable toforesee alloftheforces which might
come into play when thehost's mind accepts the
fashioned virus. Inpractice it isall but
impossible toalways predict howaninfected human
mayact. But, ifathought virus engineer constructs
afairly complete blueprint ol IlieIntended host's
mental structure aneffective thought virus should
becapable ofbeing fashioned inmost cases.
Replication
Thought viruses replicate through themedium
ofthe RSM. Theactual replication occurs within
human minds buttheviruses arepassed through the
sociocultural matrix intheform ofsymbols. These
symbols canrange from language, tobody language,
tosculpture, tofilm. Often these latent holders of
thought viruses canremain charged forlong periods
oftime before ahuman consciousness comes into
contact with them. When alatent thought virus is
perceived byahuman consciousness itwill attempt
toreplicate into themind oftheperceiving human.
Memetic Talismans andAmulets
Memetic talismans oramulets are physical
objects which hold latent thought contagions. An
individual can create aholder for athought
contagion andcharge itwith magickal power, that
is,thepower tocause change intheobjective world
according tosubjective will. This book isan
example ofamemetic talisman imbued with magickal
power through itsuseoftheEnglish language to
project symbols into themind ofareader. Thebook
contains apotent andcomplicated thought contagion
which remains latent until being perceived bya
human mind capable ofunderstanding theEnglish
written symbolic system. Insimpler terms, theideascontained within this book cannot betransmitted
until itisreadbyahuman capable ofunderstanding
theEnglish language. Ifthis book isnotreadbya
human being whounderstands theEnglish language,
thethought contagions itcontains remain latent.
Human cultures are replete with memetic
talismans. Movies, television shows, signs, and
books abound. The thought contagions contained
within cultural artifacts cannot betransmitted
until coming into contact with human minds capable
ofcomprehending theparticular symbolic system by
which theparticular artifact wascreated. Butjust
because athought virus islatent does notmean it
ceases toexist orwill evaporate outoftheRSMon
itsown. Rather, latent thought contagions areheld
within physical amulets until such atime asthe
attention ofahuman consciousness activates them.
Human minds form atemporary butrealbridge between
thelocation intheRSMwhere aparticular thought
contagion resides, and the human being who
consciously views thethought contagion.
Memetic amulets canbedestroyed; insodoing
thethought contagion embedded within will also be
lost. Butdestroying anoriginal memetic amulet is
not always sufficient toeliminate aparticular
memetic structure from the RSM. Ifathought
contagion has been transmitted to asufficient
number ofminds, itwill continue toexist and
possibly flourish within theRSMeven ifthememetic
amulet which originally transmitted itisdestroyed.
Inaddition, other infected human beings mayfashion
more amulets based on the original thought
contagion.
Forinstance, ifalloftheprototype copies
(talismans) ofthemovie Braveheart were destroyed,
theBraveheart thought contagion would continue to
exist intheminds ofmany ofthose whosawthe
movie. Some ofthepeople inwhom theBraveheart
contagion still existed would eventually make movies
(talismans) oftheir own. These movies would betoa
greater orlesser degree influenced (contaminated)
bytheoriginal Braveheart thought contagion.
Ifanindividual wished toallow aparticular
fashioned memetic structure adecent chance of
surviving the test oftime, talismans should be
Manipulation oftheRoot Social Matrix&theFabric ofReality 46Memetic Magic 47


created and Imbumi with theessence ofthememetic
structure. luvtldws theactual destruction ofthe
talismans tlmiiiHdlves, theonly practical waythey
could borendered ineffective isifthesymbolic
system (Itielanguage) used tocreate thetalismans1
became untranslatable totheconsciousness under
whose attention they fall.
ForInstance, assume anindividual engineered
acomplex memetic structure inthepresent, and
created anamulet toretain that structure inthe
form ofabook written intheEnglish language. It
isentirely possible that 4000 years into the
future, forwhatever reason (nuclear war, asteroid
impact), nohuman beings will exist able to
translate the English language. Ifaparticular
human mind cannot accept theparticular symbolic
system inwhich amemetic structure iscreated, it
cannot become infected byany thought viruses
contained within. Thethought virus would have no
means bywhich topenetrate themental structure.
Immunization
Humans canbecome immune tocertain forms of
thought viruses. Often athought virus will be
written inalanguage incomprehensible tothemind
j
which istrying toread it. The situation is
analogous toacomputer/software model. Thehuman
mind isthe computer, and itcan only accept
software written inthe correct language.
Ifa
thought virus iswritten inasymbolic language 1
unreadable bythemind inwhich itcomes into
contact, there canbenoinfection. Themind is I
immune toanythought viruses written inlanguages
itcannot understand.
Atthe macro level, the entire conscious
structure will effectively block anythought viruses
jnotcontaining areadable symbolic structure. Atthe
micro level, many thought viruses which arewritten
inareadable symbolic language will notbeaccepted
because ofthedefenses ofthememetic structures
already existing within amind.
Forinstance, an
j->any person whodisagrees withmeisstupick-
memetic structure will block theopinions (opinions
also serving asthought viruses themselves) ofanyperson whodoes notagree with thesubject. Thus, if
the->any person whodisagrees with meisstupid<-
memetic structure has created astrong enough
fortress inaparticular mind, that mind will be
immune toany thought viruses whose memetic
structures donotcontain some form ofagreement
with thetarget mind. These immunization walls are
notabsolute. Intheabove example theimmunization
wall could bebypassed byamemetic structure which
didnotagree with thetarget, aslong asitwas
hooked toamemetic -structure which didagree with
thetarget. Forexample, ifthetarget mind wasthe
stronghold ofa
->coffee tastes good<- combined with an->anyone
whodisagrees withmeisstupid<-
memetic structure, this structure could be
bypassed bya
->coffee does taste goodmost ofthetime<-
combined with a
->but Columbian coffee istoostrong formeso
Idon't think ittastes goock-
momotlc structure. The latter thought
contagion isused asanappeasement orsacrifice to
thetarget's defensive structure, binding tothe
target's immunization wall, allowing the second
portion ofthememetic structure topass through
unh itidered.
Example ofThought Virus Creation andTransmission
Anindividual might wish tobeknown asthe
most aptmathematician athisworkplace. Inthis
particular example, theindividual will intruth
notbeanaptmathematician, butthis fact isfairly
irrelevant totheworking athand. The individual
wants tocreate thebelief inhisfellow worker's
minds that heisthemost talented mathematician,
perhaps because insodoing hewill attract allof
thebilling work available.
Sotheindividual engineers athought virus.
Thevirus hecreates issimple,

None ofthese statements possesses any
objective truth, butthis detail does notmatter
iManipulation oftheRoot Social Matrix&theFabric ofReality 48 Memetic Magic 49


unless acoworker decides toresearch thetruth of
theindividual's claims.
Thefirst element ofthethought virus,
->Iearned aPhDinmathematics<-,
serves as apenetration agent. The
sociocultural sphere, i.e., thebusiness environment
inwhich theindividual works, isconducive tothose
whohave earned academic degrees. Theindividual's
coworkers hold inhigh esteem anyone whoholds an
advanced academic degree. Thus thethought virus
will bypass thetargets' mental defensive structures
through apre-existing memetic structure inthe
workplace sub-matrix, onto which itwill bind. The
preexist Irigmemet icstructure onto which thethought
v Iriimwill bind Is:
-'(hose who hold academic degrees deserve

Once thevirus haspenetrated thetarget's
defenses, theprogramming, orinstruction, isgiven:
->Iwish todothebilling work<-
This programming has ahigh probability of
being accepted duetotheknown andassumed aspects
ofthemental structures inherent inthe target
population.
Thefinal portion ofthethought virus isthe
replication mechanism. Byinforming thetarget mind
that
->Iearned myPhDatHarvard University <-,
the target becomes likely toshare that
information with hiscolleagues. Since themembers
ofthetarget social group allshare similar ideals
andrespect toward theacademic degree system, they
arelikely totransmit (tell) alloftheir workplace

individual and thedegree held. When the entire
workplace hasbeen infected bythethought virus, it
becomes very likely theindividual's desire will
become manifest. Ifeveryone knows theindividual

Ofcourse theentire process isset into

Since allhuman beings whohave hadanyprolongedcontact with society areprogrammed tosome degree,large portions ofthehuman mind (especially thethinking portion ofthe psyche which utilizeslanguage) areconstructed almost entirely ofcomplexmemetic structures. Thecomplex memetic structureswhich form thecognitive linguistic (language using)portions ofthehuman mind possess strong defenses,both passive andactive, against contamination byinvading thought viruses andmemetic structures .Ahuman mind will resist anyideas which donotbindcorrectly within theexisting memetic structureswhich form the framework of its linguistic

thereplication phase ofathought virusofwhich
theartist hasbeen infected without hisknowledge.
Most artists, like most people, areprogrammed by
thedominant rremetic structures, orcultural ideal
types. Dominant memetic structures are only
concerned with maintaining their dominance by
replicating toasmany minds aspossible, notwith
thegreater good ofhumanity, except inhow the
greater good ofhumanity serves tobenefit the
replication possibilities ofthedominant memetic
structure.
All artwork, even the most rudimentary,
contains complex memetic structures residing atmany
different levels within the work ofart. An
intelligent mind candilute awork ofartmuch asa
chemist candilute auniform mixture ofdiverse
chemicals. Recognition oftheroot meanings inherent
inartistic endeavors canlead anindividual toa
source ofgreat understanding andpower.
Artistic Symbolism
Every artistic endeavor contains numerous
symbols embedded atmany different levels within the
work ofart. Some ofthese symbols areimbedded into
theartwith willed conscious intent while others
aretheresult ofsubconscious communication. Ofthe
two types ofsymbols inherent inartwork the
subconscious symbols arethemost interesting. The
consciously created symbols within artwork are
complex memetic structures which canbecorrectly
labeled thought viruses orthought contagions,
depending onwhether thememetic structure attemptstousethemind ithasinfected forthepurpose of
further replication.
Anindividual wishing tospread fashioned
thought viruses would dowell toconsider imbedding
personal creations into awork ofartandreleasing
that work ofarttoatarget population. Theartwork
serves asanouter guise concealing thetrue form of
the thought viruses contained within. The
entertainment oraesthetic value ofawork ofart
engages theattention oftheconscious mind ofthe
individual partaking ofthework ofart, allowing
thethought viruses embedded within topenetrate the
defenses ofthe unaware target's complex mental
memetic structure. Once thethought viruses have
penetrated, instructions can bedisseminated and
replication cancommence.
Thesymbols contained within awork ofartcan
assume avariety ofdifferent forms depending onthe
type ofartbeing examined. Forthesake ofbrevity,
this chapter will focus primarily onliterature and
paintings. Buttheprincipals contained herein are
equally valid inregards toanyvariety ofartistic
endeavor.
Symbolism inLiterary Fiction
Aliterary novel will inmost cases contain
numerous elements ofsimilarity with other literary
works. Novels often contain theme, setting, moral,
andcharacters. Each ofthese individual elements
contributes tocreating theartistic whole, orthe
novel. Theartistic whole, the creation itself,
contains ameta-layer ofsymbols. This uppermost
layer contains theembedded symbolic structures in
their undiluted form. Adeeper examination ofany
work ofartwill convey theuppermost layer of
undiluted symbolic structures. Infact, such deeper
examinations ofliterary works occur daily in
university literature courses. Theproblem ismost
ofthose engaged inthediscussions focusing onthe
symbolism (root meanings) inherent inliterary work
project their ownprogrammed symbolism into the
literature, thereby missing themeaning behind the
symbols they discuss. Many college students canspot

Butallsymbols embedded within artarenot

interesting study intheir ownright, such astudy
pales incomparison tothestudy ofthehidden root

writer rereads anovel hehasrecently completed he
will discover elements oftheme, plot, setting,

writing anovel acharacter will take onalife of
hisown ;speaking andperforming actions unforeseen
bytheauthor. Unplanned subplots will bediscovered
weaving through thesymbolic tapestry ofthework
which possess unique theme, setting, characters, and
morals.
Howisitpossible forunintended symbols to
become embedded within anauthor's work? The
unintended symbols are thework oftheartist's
subconscious mind. Theactofwriting isamagickal

elements arising from the author's subconscious
mind. Writing orpainting directs andfocuses the
full attention oftheconscious mind. While the

Asymbol isare-presentation ofaparticular
spirit embedded (orembodied) inartistic form. What
is asymbol? Asymbol is acomplex memetic

complex memetic structure isacollection ofmemos.
Thus even spirits arecomplex memetic structures
which canbebroken down, ordiluted. Thus, one
spirit will contain many spirits. Spirits, like the
artistic works inwhich they are captured, are
multi-tiered hierarchal entities.
Todisregard aspirit assomething less than a
potentially powerful entity isamistake. Spirits
are the embodied symbolic aspects ofunified
portions ofthehuman subconscious mind. Butthis
definition innowaydiscredits their reality and
power. After all, what istheunconscious mind? What
even istheconscious mind?
ATheory ofMind
Insimplistic terms, thehuman consciousness
consists ofthree collaborating parts: sensory
input, thought, andemotion. Thebrain combines the
filtered input from thefive senses regarding the
objective (outside) world and presents the
information tothe ego, orthe I.Vision is
presented asathree dimensional full color display
inthemind, into which areintegrated thesenses of
sound, touch, taste, andsmell.
The ego views this sensory display and
considers the derived re-presentation of the
objective universe with thoughts.
Thoughts take up
nospace, yetthey doappear tooccur over definite
periods oftime. Thoughts cantake theform ofany
ofthefive physical senses, especially thesight
sense, but most often thoughts manifest
linguistically. Language is alearned symbolic
system where certain sounds accompanied byword
signs represent distinct elements inthedajective
universe. Not only dohumans use language to
communicate with other humans, human beings also

Theconscious mind isnot aseparate mind in

Manipulation oftheRoot Social Matrix&theFabric ofReality 5Kevolution, orprojection ofthesubconscious mind to
better allow thehuman organism tosurvive ina
sometimes hostile physical world. Butthough the
conscious mind isnotseparate from theunconscious
mind itcanincertain circumstances dominate the
totality ofthemind much asadictator might
dominate asubjected population. This isoneofthe
underlying principals ofmagick: tocause effective
magickal change intheobjective universe amagician
must unify hiswill. Total unification ofthewill
means atemporary alliance between theegoandall
oftheelements ofthesubconscious directed toward
asingular purpose.
Total unification of the will is
extraordinarily difficult. Fortunately, total
unification ofthewill isnotalways necessary to
perform magickal acts. Inmany cases partial unity
will suffice tocause willed change intheobjective
universe. Only thehighest magickal acts require
complete unification ofthewill.
Thesubconscious mind isamassive structure
containing numerous thoughts, personal Jt.less,
desires, memetic structures, emotions, instincts,
powers, andmany other elements scientists have yet
toname. None ofthestructures isphysical. The
realm ofthesubconscious isanentirely mental
construct. Butbecause theego canonly perceive
symbolic structures, anyconscious contact with the
unconscious realm will beperceived bytheegoas
symbolic physical representations ofthat which is
notphysical innature. Therefore, since spirits
(entities within theunconscious) arenotphysical
innature they canonly beperceived through the
symbols inwhich they make themselves manifest.
Thevarious elements ofthesubconscious realm
struggle amongst themselves for control ofthe
greater mind andtheego. Inmost cases theego

actions arising from the subconscious. This is
analogous tomemetic programming. Theegothinks it

isolation results inchange which iscorrespondingly
less attributed tothewill oftheegoandmore
attributed tothewill ofsomething else, whether

subconsc ioua.
TheSubconscious Landscape
When the ego come3 incontact with the
subconscious mind thevaried forces contained within
are perceived assymbolic structures .Symbolic
because what theegoperceives isare-presentation
ofanexisting force present but not present
physically .Structures because allbut themost
basic forces ofthesubconscious arehierarchal
alliances which could theoretically bebroken down
into smaller elements. Just asamemetic structure
istheresult ofacomplex combination ofmemes, a
spirit istheresult ofacomplex unification of
spirits.
Large potions ofthe human mentality are
incredibly complex memetic structures, or
frameworks, composed ofvast numbers ofmemes, or
ideological structures. This suggests that if
memetic structures become complex enough, they can
form consciousness outofnothing more than the
correct configuration ofmemes. Spirits arememetic
structures which havebecome socomplex they have
evolved limited forms ofconsciousness .Themost
powerful ofspirits mayhave evolved within the
evolutionary accelerator ofthesubconscious mind to
such heights that their conscious structures are
superior tothose of the traditional human
conscious. Such spirits mayhave developed psychic
powers. Itmaybethat when ahuman physic uses his
orherpower, what itreally happening istheegoof
Manipulation oftheRoot Social Matrix&theFabric ofReality 60thepsychic iscoming into contact with, orevoking,
aspirit within hisorhermind which hasacquired,^
through spiritual evolution, atype ofultra-
consciousness.
Ifthespirit theory ofconscious evolution is
accepted, itleads onetoconsider thepossibility
that amemetic engineer could theoretically fashion
amemetic structure socomplex itwould. create anew
form ofconsciousness which would coexist within or
replace the current consciousness utilized bya
human being. This new consciousness could
theoretically contain thekeys which would unlock
human psychic potential. Inother words, a
sufficiently skilled memetic engineer could
transform anormal human being into apsychic.
Theunconscious landscape istruly massive,
fartoolarge fortheegotoexplore inalifetime.
The landscape isformed by acombination of
inherited mental traits andenvironmental input.
Every instinct, thought, memory, oridea wehold
assumes afairly constant symbolic form somewhere
within the vast expanse of the subconscious
landscape. Forexample, afear offlying mighttae
theform ofabusy airport. Alove ofgems might be
symbolized byavast network ofsubterranean caverns
whose walls are filled with precious stones.. A
particularly enslaving memetic structure might
assume theform ofacruel slave master donning
garments which symbolize hispowers. Again, though
these forces are symbolic, they arenevertheless
very real, and inmany cases have, evolved tothe
point ofbecoming self-aware entities. Spirits are
real whether they are projections of the
subconscious mind ornot.
Butthough theunderlying structure ofthe
subconscious landscape remains fairly stable (except
inrare circumstances where massive mental change
hasoccurred) thedetails areconstantly changing.
Ourmental defenses areunder constant assault as
numerous thought contagions attempt tobind toour
subconscious mental structures. Asteady percentage
of thought contagions affect successful
penetrations. Each successful thought contagion
penetration alters themental landscape.

secret ofhuman history andevolution. Thin leads us
toArtistic Memetic Magick proper.
Evocation through (Automatic) Painting
The simplest variety ofartistic memetic
magick ispracticed through methodical painting. The
term painting isused asaninclusive label
referring toanyform ofpicture composition. K.very
variety ofartistic composition; from acrylic,
watercolor, andpencil sketches all the way to
rudimentary cave paintings areincluded within the
picture composition sphere. Ahigh degree of
painting skill isnot necessary; anyone who
possesses workable hands and even rudimentary
painting skills canboth evoke spirits andembed
complex memet iestructures into paint inqs. Of
course, thegreater theskills ofthepainter the
more aesthetically pleasing Lhepaintings will be,
buteven lowquality paintings cananddoachieve
desired effects.
Evocation istheartandscience ofcalling
forth spirits. Itshould berecalled that theterm
spirit andtheterm complex memetic structure,
when
used inrelation tothehuman subconscious, are
synonymous.
When aspirit isevoked, acomplex memetic
structure issummoned from its home within the
subconscious mind outtotheattention oftheego.
Within thesubconscious mind thespirit isfairly
impervious tothedesires oftheego. Theegohasno
means ofdirect contact with thespirit. Inmost
cases, theegodoes noteven know thespirit exists.
While aspirit remains locked within the
subconscious mind, theegoisunable tosubject the
spirit toits will. Rather, the situation is
reversed; theego isoften subject tothewill of
thespirit. Butwhen thespirit issummoned outto
theattention ofthe ego, itcanbemanipulated
according tothepowers inherent intheego.
Thespirit will often bepossessed ofpowers
andknowledge unknown, orunder normal circumstances
inaccessible,
tothe ego. The spirit, operating
under the guide ofits own will within the
subconscious mind, ineffect steals acertain
percentage ofinformation which would under othercircumstances berelayed totheego. Inaddition to
this siphoning ofmental energy, thespirit isable
tointeract with other spirits andaspects ofthe
subconscious mind and the astral plane, thereby
gathering further information andpower inaccessible
totheego. This information remains bound tothe
memetic structure which constitutes the spirit's
form. Unless the spirit decides, for whatever
reason, that theinformation andpowers itcontains
should beshared with theego, theonly wayforthe
egotoaccess theknowledge andpowers ofthespirit
isbybringing (evoking) thespirit totheattention
• oftheIconsciousness.
Therefore evocation of spirits through
‘ methodical painting allows amagician tounlock or
access theinformation andpowers which have been
withheld anddeveloped within hissubconscious mind.
Thepower locked within thesubconscious mind
isconsiderable and theoretically holds nearly
| infinite potential. Inoccult terminology, the
jsubconscious mind contains theportal totheastral
plane, and theastral plane contains theportal
leading to •thehigher planes. Asufficiently strong
ego using the proper magickal techniques could
theoretically summon andcontrol anyspirit.
Theprocess ofevocation through methodical
painting isfairly simple. Most people have evoked
many spirits without realizing they were sodoing.
Thedanger ofunknowingly invoking aspirit rests
with thespirit's potential toaffect both theego
and theobjective universe (the material world).
T When aspirit isevoked, with orwithout conscious
intent, itisbrought into direct contact and
manifestation with thematerial world. Under normal
circumstances the spirit's powers toaffect the
material world arediluted; most spiritual actions
onthematerial plane arechecked by,orchanneled
through, theego. Butwhen summoned, aspirit can
directly wield itssometimes considerable power to
affect change onthematerial plane. Thus, aspirit
< evoked unknowingly mayaffect direct change onthe
material plane according toitswill; these changes
maybejudged good, neutral, orevil with regards to
theego (the I)andthehuman organism. Inmany
cases aspirit will beout for itsownbenefit
Manipulation oftheRoot Social Matrix&theFabric ofReality 64 Memetic Magic 65


irregardless ofthegood ofthehuman organism asa
whole. Thus ifaspirit isunknowingly evoked, the
egowill notbeproperly equipped (orforewarned) to
handle sudden abnormal change inthematerial world.
Inthecase ofaspirit acting with evil intent
toward themagician, abattle will befought between
aspirit whohasawilled plan, andanegothat has
noidea abattle iseven being fought.
Thus itisimportant foramagician toalways
beaware ofspirits shemay evoke. Anyartistic
process will contain thevery real possibility of
eliciting spirits. Thedanger islimited tosome
degree as the most powerful spirits, who
correspondingly possess thegreatest danger tothe
unwary magician, are often theeasiest tospot.
Powerful spirits arecapable ofcausing considerable
change inthematerial world, andlarge-scale change
rarely passes unnoticed totheego.
Therefore, before amagician attempts to
willfully evoke spirits, heshould become adept at
the fundamentals ofmagick. Amagician needs to
develop self-control. Self-discipline is an
essential element both forcausing willed change and
protecting oneself from such change. Before a
magician cancontrol theuniverse hemust beable to
control himself. Magickal fundamentals serve to
protect themagician from thesometimes dangerous
spirits which maybeevoked. Magicians cause change
inthematerial world according totheir will.
Changes inthematerial world canbebeneficial,
neutral, orharmful tothehuman organism. Even the
most powerful magicians make occasional mistakes.
Causing aninappropriate alteration ineither the
organism orthe material world can result in
profound detriment andeven lead totheannihilation
ofthemagician. Self-discipline isessential tothe
magickal arts. Without self discipline amagician is
meddling with forces which may destroy himand
others .
Though very often magick isabout removing or
clearing impedimentary memetic structures tofree
oneself from sociocultural control, itisalso very
important toretain those memetic structures which
serve toallow theorganism tosurvive andfunction
well within aparticular social system. Amagician

desired, but inartistic evocation distract, ionof
theconscious mind produces more consistent quality
spirit manifestations which areeasily recognizable
assuch. Theactofdrawing itself distracts the
conscious mind sufficiently toallow theevocation
ofspirits. Butthegreater thedegree ofconscious
distraction, thestronger will bethemanifestation
ofthespiritual form. Thus, amagician isfree to
choose either asecluded temple or acrowded
shopping mall toperform anevocation. Theworking
will besuccessful ineither case aslong asproper
distraction oftheconscious mind occurs. Incrowded
locations thecrowd itself andthenoise generated
bythecrowd will serve todistract theconscious
mind tosome degree, while inasecluded locale
purposeful distraction techniques should be
utilized. Oftentimes combining both environmental
distraction with purposeful distraction techniques
will achieve thebest results. For instance, a
solitary room inahouse might beselected to
perform anartistic evocation, with thedoor and
windows shut toblock offdistractions from the
outside world. Theradio andthetelevision might be
purposefully maintained atamedium level ofvolume
toprovide environmental distraction.
Once theproper materials have been assembled
andenvironmental conditions realized, theactual
evocation isafairly simple matter. Itmaycome as
shock tomany howeasy itistoactually evoke a
spirit. Anyhuman being without serious physical or
mental impediments should beable toachieve some
noticeable success with evocation. Asmall
percentage ofhumans will possess natural talents
conducive totheevocation ofspirits, andanequal
percentage will possess natural inhibitions which
serve tostifle anyevocational abilities. Butthe
vast majority ofhuman beings, probably well over
90%ofthehuman population, arefully capable of
evoking spirits through thepractice ofsome form of
Artistic Memetic Magick.
Theevocation occurs while thedrawing is
being drawn. While theconscious mind isfocused on
theactofdrawing, spirits areable toassume a
degree ofcontrol over thephysical body which issufficient tocause minor alterations inthedrawing
itself. When thedrawing isfinished, itshould be
examined, whereby these minor changes and their
effect onthewhole will becomprehended. Numerous
micro-changes inadrawing often adduptosingle,
noticeable, macro-change. Themacro-changes arethe
t bodies ofthespirits. It's that simple. Noarcane
words ofpower orritual other than the act of
jdrawing arenecessary. Thus, every work ofartever
created can beexamined forevoked spirits, and
every single work ofart ofanycomplexity will
contain them. Ahigh percentage ofunintentionally
evoked spirits are difficult tospot with an
untrained eye, but nevertheless they doexist,
> embedded within theartistic tapestry. Once one
knows what tolook forspotting embedded spirits is
] not adifficult matter.
Ofcourse, thesimple actofdrawing evokes
only themost rudimentary spirits which will often
bedifficult torecognize forwhat they are. To
summon greater spirits acouple of further
techniques need tobeincorporated into thedrawing
process. These techniques should beutilized
t whenever possible forthere seems tobeareal
jcorrelation between themanifestation level ofa
spirit anditspower. Inother words, theclearer
there-presentation ofthespirit themore change it
islikely toproduce inthematerial world.
Toevoke greater spirits aprocess of
automatic painting should beused. Anautomatic
y painting is apainting composed more orless
|completely bythesubconscious mind. Itiscommonly
assumed that automatic painting can only be
accomplished byrare individuals whopossess some
natural talent toward such obscure arts .This isnot
atallthecase. Most anyone canbetaught todraw
decent to high-quality automatic paintings.
Automatic drawing with apencil can beachieved
fairly easily when certain rules arefollowed.
Automatic painting faithfully follows memetic
magick principals. Theconscious mind isdistracted
toallow thesubconscious mind control over the
body. With this control over thebody thedenizens
oftheunconscious mind, thespirits, take thehands
68Memetic MagicManipulation oftheRoot Social Matrix&theFabric ofReality69


and force them todraw pictures representing the
spiritual beings incontrol. Themore control a
spirit hasover thephysical body, theclearer the
picture ofit(themanifestation ofitsform) will
be.
Every evocation session will notbethesame.
Some will bemore successful than others, owing toa j
number offactors, some ofwhich arebeyond the
control oftheartist. Biological (thehealth ofthe
jhuman organism, lack orexcess ofnutrition or
exercise),environmental (indoor oroutdoor, time of >
day, magnetic andgravitational fields, city or
rural area, moisture inthe air, season), and
j
spiritual (mental health, current landscape ofthe
astral plane and subconscious mind, current
^dominance byoneparticular spirit) factors canplay
major orminor roles relating tothequality ofan
evocatory undertaking. Butonanaverage dayunder
;common circumstances the described process of
automatic painting should result inthesuccessful
evocation ofaspirit (ormany spirits, asthecase
maybe).
Theautomatic painter follows thesame rules !
andprocedures aswould aregular painter. Theonly'
alteration inthe ritual istheactual physical
manner inwhich thepictures are drawn. While a
regular painter would likely have ageneral idea of
what itwashewasattempting todraw, anautomatic1
painter would purposefully clear hismind ofany
preconceived images. Infact, anautomatic painter'
should attempt nottoconsider hispainting atall.
Atthe moment hebegins topaint, heshouldf
purposefully turn hisattention away from thework
athand toward some other distraction, such as
conversation with another person, thetelevision, or
theradio. Thedrawing should commence without any
preconceived goal. Theactual actofdrawing should
follow two general rules. These rules are not
absolute and can bebroken onoccasion but the
artist should attempt tofollow therules whenever
possible.
Manipulation oftheRoot Social Matrix&theFabric ofReality 70General Rules forAutomatic Drawing:
1)Thepainting should becomposed inan
outline form.
2)Theoutlines should becomposed oftiny
back andforth continuous line segments.
Theinitial picture should bedrawn inoutline
form. That is,theentire drawing will beanoutline
ofacomplex figure orintersecting outlines of
complex figures. These outline borders can be
numerous and close, even touching and passing
through each other, butbynomeans should the
artist attempt tocolor inempty sections, except
theoccasional shading ofanempty area between the
outlines iftheartist iscompelled todoso.After
thepicture iscomplete, detail andcolor canbe
added toemphasize particular areas ofthedrawing.
Theoutlines should bedrawn with quick, tiny,
back andforth movements ofthepencil. Onamacro
scale these tiny back and forth movements will
combine toform what appear tobecontinuous,
purposeful lines, butonamicro scale, ifthelines
areexamined closely, they will beseen forwhat
they are; tiny connected chains ofostensibly random
andchaotic lines.
Onthefirst fewoccasions automatic drawing
isattempted, theartist should purposefully not
directly look athispicture while drawing. Rather,
thegaze should befocused toward atelevision set
oranother part oftheroom. Thepicture being drawn
should only bevisible inthecorner oftheartist's
visual field. Directing conscious attention toward
thepicture tends todisrupt subconscious spiritual
control, though with experience the eyes can be
focused toward thepicture without disrupting the
subconscious intent. Theartist isstriving todraw
thepicture atalevel just below willed conscious
intent.
Aslines aredrawn with tiny, swift, back and
forth motions ofthepencil, andconscious attention
isfocused onsomething besides thepicture, the
hand with thepencil will begin tostray onitsown.
Memetic Magic 71


Ifastrong spirit isbeing evoked, thehand can
literally beguided bytheevoked spirit tosuch an
extant itwill appear tomove without anyconscious
intent. Theconscious mind will notgive thehand
anycommands tomove, yetthehand will move onits
own, drawing apicture which onmany occasions will
contain more complexity andartistic merit than any
picture theartist could have consciously drawn.
Strong evocations are rare, but even within
evocations oflesser degrees ofmagnitude noticeable
subconscious control will beevident.
Below are two examples ofspirits evoked
utilizing automatic drawing technique. Thesecond
drawing will bediscussed atlength momentarily, but
forthemoment take note ofhoweach ofthedrawings
consist ofoutlined figures, notdetailed images.
Greater detail can beadded after anartist has
developed some skill with theautomatic painting
process.

solitary location with minimal dint rant Ion, buther

without conscious intent.
Notice howtheFlame Angel demount raten many
oftheproperties ofspirits discussed earlier. The
spirit ishierarchal. What appears upon Initial
observation tobeasingle spirit—awinged woman
with fiery hair who isreaching outwith her a*ms
andhands toward theobserver —isupon <yaer
examination aconglomeration ofnumerous spirits.
Each section ofthe drawing contains numerous
embedded spirits.
The macro level spirit, the Flame Angel
herself, isapictorial re-presentation ofavery
complex andpowerful memetic structure. Thenumerous
separate spirits whotogether comprise herform are
each pictorial re-presentations ofsmaller memetic
structures. TheFlame Angel isthememetic molecule;
the lesser spirits are thememetic atoms which
together fashion thegreater molecule. Acomplex
memetic structure like theFlame Angel would bevery
difficult todraw without utilizing automatic
painting techniques. Flame Angel istheendresult
ofmany years, ifnotdecades, ofmemetic evolution,
combination, and recombination within the
subconscious mind andtheastral plane. Whatever the
humble origins ofFlame Angel mayhave been, years
ordecades later theresult ofmemetic evolution was
asentient thought form capable ofcausing direct
andmeasurable change within thematerial world on
itsown.
Impressive andawe-inspiring asthis may be,
itshould benoted that Flame Angel undoubtedly has
undergone further transformation since this book was
written. Shemay have become more complex and
potent, orsimpler anddevoid ofreal power. Itis
even possible she may have been destroyed or
expelled from themind inwhich shewasbirthed. Rut
even ifFlame Angel hasbeen vanquished from tier
Manipulation oftheRoot Social Matrix&theFabric ofReality 748original mental home, shelives on,forherpicture
which isprinted inthis book ischarged. That is,
theartistic rendition ofFlame Angel possesses the
potential toreplicate itself within themind ofany
conscious-possessing biological organism which views
it.
Asafascinating side note, letusassume for
theoretical sake that Flame Angel isable to
replicate herself into theminds of500people who
read this book. Ofthese 500,perhaps only 100orso
will accept hertrue form (accepting thetrue form
ofaspirit isthesame asthesuccessful binding of
itscomplete memetic structure into theframework of
ahuman mind) .Theother 400people will only accept
portions ofhertrue form. TheFlame Angel memetic
structure will evolve separately within theminds of
those 100people whoaccept hertrue form. After a
year ortwohaspassed, each oneoftheoriginal
faithful replications ofFlame Angel will have
mutated, evolved, ordevolved in100unique ways
within 100unique mental environments. The Flame
Angel spirit type would thus expand out into the
human population and asaresult ofthis expansion
unprecedented powers andunique forms corresponding
to survival strategies within new mental
environments would emerge. Ofcourse thesurvival of
thespirit isnotguaranteed, buttheevolutionary
processes defining spiritual development within
human minds areafascinating subject toconsider.
Theoretically spirits could evolve with the
power tolead thehuman race into agolden age, but
itisequally possible spirits could evolve which
would possess thepower toenslave oreliminate
humanity altogether. (Remember that spirits
arecomplex memetic structures --albeit socomplex
astohave acquired conscious-like systems oftheir
own. Many complex memetic structures arethought
viruses, andthought viruses dohave thepotential
tocause macro-scale alteration ofhuman cultural
systems.)

Powerful evoked spirits will often follow the
general pattern established bytheFlame Angel. The
most potent spirits wi 11contain akind of
mathematical symmetry which would bevery difficult,
ifnotimpossible, toconsciously create. Aperfect
example ofthis symmot ry isthe concurrently
composed dual unique images, theFlame Angel andthe

evoked (drawn) bytheprocess ofautomatic drawing
theconscious mind oftheartist wasonly aware of
theFlame Angel. Itcame asaneerie shock when the
evocation wascomplete, andFlame Angvl wasinverted
toreveal theSorcerer.
Amagician should beextremely cautious with
any spirit displaying such cha racteristics.
Mathematically symmetrical spirits arevery powerful
spirits indeed. Theartist should watch closely for
threatening changes inthematerial world arising
sometime soon after the evocation has been
completed. Though some powerful evoked spirits may
attempt tohelp the magician, many will cause
changes which will have thepotential toseriously
hurt oreven destroy anunwary magician. These
changes inthefabric ofthematerial world need not
occur immediately upon commencement ofanevocation,
though sometimes they will. Onmany occasions the
changes maytake time tomanifest inthematerial
world. Direct spiritual influence onmaterial
reality isusually dependant upon amagician
entering into asituation wherein aspirit can
effectively wield itspowers. Many spirits will wait
patiently inthebackground until anopportunity
presents itself, owing toacorrect configuration of
material reality conducive totherelease ofthe
spirit's inherent power. Thelength oftime that

The practice ofwilled artistic evoesf ionfollows the guidelines for random artintic
evocation, butontopofthese guidelines newritual
isadded toachieve thedesired effect.
Manipulation oftheRoot Social Matrix&theFabric ofReality X()Letusassume thespirit Mars istobeevoked.
First, asmuch information about Mars and his
•pecific characteristics should begathered as
possible. The source ofthis information is
unimportant except inregards toitsvalidity. If
true characteristics areused tocreate themagickal
framework. Mars islikely tobesuccessfully evoked.
Iffalse information isused tocreate themagickal
framework thewrong spirit maybesummoned.
Just tokeep things simple, only afew
characteristics ofMars will belisted.
Characteristics ofMars
Thecolor red
Theplanet Mars
Agodofwarfare
Anaggressive nature
Attracted bycourage
Repelled byfear
Thepossession ofthis information allows the
evocation tobeattempted. There arenonot.rules
for the construction of .hieffect ivo magickal
framework. Anything which serves toeither change
theenvironment ordirect themind ofthemagician
toward the rootessence ofthespirit tobesummoned
canwork. Forinstance, aneffective environmental
location inwhich toattempt tosummon Mars might be
onthefront lines ofawarzone. Oratemple maybe
constructed which ispainted redandfilled with
symbols ofMars. Theevocation could beperformed
outdoors under thenight sky atatime when the
Vplanet Mars isvisible above. Thevariations on
these themes arealmost endless.
Butartistic memetic magick provides afairly
simple means forachieving the same end result,
without the necessity of utilizing extreme
environmental components intheritual setup. The
artist should consciously draw symbols representing
thecharacteristics ofMars onto hispaper before
theactual evocation isattempted. These symbols--
which inthis case might beadrawing ofasword, a
drawing oftheplanet Mars, amemetic molecule whose
atoms aretheindividual characteristics ofMars,
allsuperimposed over acrimson redbackground

should bedrawn Inanormal fashion without the
artist utIII/,lugautomatic drawing techniques.
Afairly large empty area should bemaintained
within Ihocanter ofthedrawing paper. This empty
area in Ilia gonm ofevocation wherein automatic
drawing Iouhnlquea will beutilized inanattempt to
evoke Maim, Ifden Ired, the empty area may be
arl I.Mlli'nlly Trained before attempted evocation. For
inulrincfs, amirror frame could bedrawn around the
edgon of Iheempty /one, preferably with symbols ofMaru embedded wllliln, When the evocation is
attempted, the face ofthemirror would bedrawn
upon, thereby giving the flnlrihed product the

mirror. Kndlo.n.n varlalIona oftheborder theme can
beattempted, nolong aasome clear area remainswherein evocation canmanifest.
Once the nagickal framework iscomplete, theartist should utilize automatic drawing techniqueswithin theempty portion oftheframework. Thefocus
oftheconscious mind should bemaintained upon thesymbols ofthe spirit tobesummoned while the
automatic drawing occurs. Thefocus oftheconsciousmind onthepurposefully created symbols should
provide thenecessary impetus tosummon thedesired
spirit from thesubconscious mind.
Whether thedesired spirit hasbeen evoked can
beeffectively judged after theautomatic drawing is
complete. Thedesired spirit should have afairly
recognizable form although on some occasions
intuition isnecessary todetermine itthecorrectspirit hasbeen evoked.
Ifthedesired spirit hasbeen evoked, itmay
attempt tocommunicate, assist, orharm themagicianwhosummoned it.These spiritual effects can Lake
almost any form. Amagician who has recentlycompleted asuccessful evocation should watch Tor
changes inthematerial world which mayhave been
caused bythe summoned spirit. Sometimes themagician maybetested inthe real world bythe
spirit. Ifthespiritual test ispassed, spiritual
benefits will begranted; ifitisfailed, thepowers will bewithheld. Failure oftests staged by
spirits mayhave more dire consequences aswe 1 1.

Wh«n words orsymbols arerecognized within the
tVOked spirit's pictorial form. Allevoked spirits
hould bestudied carefully forthepresence ofsuch

Literary Evocation (Through Semi-Automatic Writing)
Aswasdiscussed earlier inthis chapter,
literary works often contained numerous embedded
spirits. Abook itself canbecorrectly labeled a
macro-level spirit. Within literary works spirits
often take theform ofcharacters. Characters have
character traits, and these particular character
traits tend tolead tocertain characterized
actions. Thecharacters canbeclassified assecond
tier spirits, the particular traits ofthese
characters asthird tier spirits, theactions they
take asfourth tier spirits, andsoon.
Ofcourse, thetier labeling system ofspirits
isalways relative. Acharacter inanovel isonly a
second tier spirit when judged incomparison tothe
novel asawhole. Ifthecharacter isisolated from
thenovel, itbecomes afirst tier spirit, andits
traits become second tier spirits, andsoon.
Thesituation canbecome more complex when the
elements ofplot, setting, andmoral arefactored
In. Each ofthese elements can becorrectly
distinguished asembedded spirits aswell. The
effects these elements have onthe individual
characters arealso embedded spirits.
Theevocation ofaliterary spirit follows the
same general philosophy and principals asan
evocation ofapainted spirit, except inorder to
evoke and embed spirits into literary works a
magician needs towrite. Theactofwriting focuses
theconscious mind, allowing spirits toslip into
theliterary work from thesubconscious. After a
literary work hasbeen completed, theauthor should
reread thework andtake note ofelements which seem
tohave taken alife oftheir own.
Most literary works arefilled with symbols.
Theclearer thesymbol, themore likely itistobe

byactions between characters. These symbols will
almost invariably represent embedded spirits, for

Intheprocess ofwilling nliterary work anauthor
stands anexcel lent chance ofevoking numerous
spirits andembedding these spirits into thework.
Further, thespirits evoked through thewriting
process will cause real change inthematerial
world.
The spirits embedded within aliterary
composition effect the material world intwo
distinct manners. Embedded literary spirits affect
changes intheminds, andtherefore theactions, of
thereaders. When aperson reads abook, hebecomes
contaminated orattacked bythe complex memetic
structures (spirits) contained within. Ifthese
spirits successfully bind tothereader's mental
framework, they will cause change inhispattern of
thought, leading tochange inaclion, andtherefore
change intheobjective material world.
Buttheembedded spirits ina IHorary work do
notjust affect thereader; they affect theauthor
aswell. Infact theeffects ontheauthor will
likely bemuch more profound than onthereader. For
areader ofaliterary work issimply bringing their
conscious mind into contact wi’th spirits whohave
been bound into textual symbols and which willpossess thepossibility ofbeing transmit led, but
theauthor actually evokes thespirits which are to
become embedded intheworks from out ofthe
subconscious mind. Theactofevocation often brings
the evoker into direct contact with the evoked
spirit, whomaythen attempt tohelp, harm, orlest
theauthor. Sowhen anauthor composes aliterary
work, thevery actofwriting cancause changes in
thematerial world which will affect him direct ly.

Any type ofliterary composition can bea

theextent which theauthor's subconscious mind is
able toslip past conscious defenses. Fiction,
nonfiction, short stories, and poetry are some
examples oflegitimate literary magick.
Thevery real possibility should beconsidered
that inmany cases, awork ofartitself istheroot

NEPTUNE'S HARLOT
Five yuars have passed since that accursed day, but
Ifeel asthough mymental state has improved
sufficiently toallow metowrite ofmyexperience.
Though Istill suffer flashbacks, andoften wake inthe
middle ofthenight screaming, sometimes Iregain my
sanity long enough tofunction, and inthese moments I
realize that Ihave aresponsibility torecord mytale no
mat Iorhowpainful theprocess maybe.Sowith onefinal
swig ofvodka Isettle behind mydesk overlooking the
linthotandbegin towrite...
Thai day began like almost any other. Ihad
alrolled 11unimydowntown apartment tothe market,
appr o.k*h 1iu) n I insh I Iahvendor with the intent of
purchasing aniced specimen toprepare formydinner. As
Iwasabout tomake mypurchase acool hand closing
around mywrist stopped me.
"Wait. Don't waste your money here. Iknow abetter
place wecango."
Iturned tobehold anattractive woman inher
twenties. Shewastall andtrim, standing five foot ten,
with blonde hair which curled tightly into braids that
dropped down tohershoulders. Herhairstyle wasforeign;
theedges were bleached like shehadspent toomuch time
under adistant sun. Though shewore theclothing ofa
woman herage, tight black pants and afinebrown leather
jacket, shehad alook inherkelp green eyes that spoke
ofexperiences well beyond heryears. Iwasmomentarily
mesmerized, butshecontinued when Icould notspeak.
"Are youbusy? Whydon't youtake meouttoeat? I
know this great seafood restaurant."
"Do Iknow you? Imean, dowork with me?I'mnot
sure ifI've seen you..."
Sheshrugged andreplied,
"Iknow enough about youalready. Ipromise, this
restaurant isavery special place. Aplace youwon't
want tomiss."
Atthis point the day had already taken the
qualities ofadream, andperhaps this iswhy Iagreed
without further thought totake this mysterious stranger
todinner onawhim.
Wewalked slowly tomycar, where Ilearned her
name wasCyrene, andthat sheclaimed tobeemployed asamarine biologist whotraveled sixmonths outoftheyear
onaresearch vessel. Ifound this fascinating, butwhen
Iattempted toquestion herfurther onthesubject, she
Manipulation oftheRoot Social Matrix&theFabric ofReality 86cutmyqueries short. Iasked herwhere wewere headed,
andshereplied that
"The restaurant isattheendoftheroad."
Inaturally assumed that shewasspeaking ofthe
road wewere on,butitsoon became apparent this wasnot
thecase. Shedirected metothefreeway. Aswedrove she
grew quiet, speaking only inshort sentences and
occasionally pointing formetoturn here, orthere, and
soon wewere well outside thecity andhadpassed through
thelast ofthesuburbs. Itold her Iwasnotfamiliar
with this area andagain Iasked herwhere wewere going,
butsheonly repeated herprevious answer, urging meto
continue driving onthecountry highway andtoroll down
thewindows soshecould breathe thefresh air.
Reaching thesummit ofahill, theocean became
visible not far ahead. Cyrene pointed to abuilding
rising above therocky beach. Idrove thefinal couple of
miles until wereached therestaurants gravel parking
lot, andthere Icould clearly seetheneon blue sign
which read 'THE NEPTUNE'. Thewords were superimposed
over .irit<xy imnm.iid wielding aneon pink trident. Iwas
ampiland inrind theparking lotwascrowded considering
Iho Imilatml local ton ofthe restaurant . Iparked,
looking ovnitoCyrene. Agrin traced thecorners ofher
IIpa .
"Wn'ie lieto." mhewhispered. "Come on,let's eat. I
tretyou're starving after that drive."
1followed herthrough therestaurant's fishnet
veiled front doors. Thehost had thesame strange sun-
bleached hairstyle asCyrene, andhereyes were asimilar
shade ofgreen. Ithought atfirst they might besisters,
but when they did not speak toeach other with any
familiarity Idecided tothecontrary.
"You twoareinluck. We've had acancellation, and
there's anexcellent table available."
Asingle portal, made toresemble theairlock ofa
submarine, leddown aflight ofaquamarine stairs into
therestaurant proper. Golden statuettes ofmermaids
wielding tridents stood guard atthebottom ofthesteps.
Iimmediately recognized whysomany hadchosen todine
attheestablishment. Therestaurant hadbeen built below
sealevel, andthewalls ononeside oftheroom were
nothing butwindows which looked into thesea. Theinside
lights hadbeen dimmed toallow thediners abetter view
ofthewater, which inturn wasilluminated inmany eerie
shades byslowly rotating submerged lights.
Idonotthink anyaquarium intheworld could have
compared tothis room. Allofthecreatures ofthesea
were represented. There were tropical fish, glowing fish,
Memetic Magic 87


crabs, squids, anoctopus ifIwere toattempt tolist
allthat Isaw 1would surely fill another page. Buteven
amidst such splendid variety there was one type of
creature that captured myimmediate attention. Roaming
amongst thecoral and thekelp were sharks whose size
would have been enough tofrighten thestrongest ofmen.
There were many species ofshark, with oneoddity in
their distribution. Noshark that wasconsidered harmless
wasanywhere tobeseen. Thewaters were patrolled by
great whites, hammerheads, and many other lethal
subspecies.
"Don't worry about them," Cyrene tried toreassure
me,pulling mebymycoat sleeve toourtable inthefar
corner. "Look outthere." Shepointed offbehind the
outermost coral reef, andfor amoment Ididnotsee
anything.
"Wait. They' recoming."
Istill could notseeanything andwasabout to
stop trying when 1caught ashadow gliding through the
darkness; then another, andthen many others. Thelarge
shadows passed under the furthest ofthe colored
searchlights. Iwatched inawe asapack ofsixgray
whales emerged from asapphire mist andmade alazy
approach toward therestaurant. Everything gotout of
their way, even thesharks. Iwasafraid they would keep
coming andperhaps collide with thewindows, butthey
slowed their approach andremained attheoutskirts of
theinner coral reef.
Toput itbluntly, Iamcertain that Ihadnever
seen soamazing asight inmylife. Isatdown inmy
chair, never once taking myeyes off thewindows. I
followed themovements ofthewhales foranother five
minutes before Cyrene snapped meout ofmytrance,
placing amenu inmylap.
"Come on, "shegrinned, "the sooner weorder the
sooner wecaneat!"
Ilooked upather, then back down atmymenu,
which Iread under theeerie fluorescent green light
projected from thewater. Themenu hadeverything Icould
ever have wanted andmore. Forstarters there wassalmon,
prawns, andoysters. Iflipped thepage anddidnoteven
bother toread beyond the first few lines, because
already Ihadseen many deliciously described entrees.
Thewaitress came over, butbefore Ihad achance tosay
anything Cyrene ordered usboth thechef’s special. This
wasagreeable, so Itook theopportunity toscan the
restaurant’s patrons.
Nearly every table was full, andthose seated at
the tables were very much like me. They looked likenormal people outfor agood dinner. Most were couples,
butthere were also some families andpeople seated by
themselves. Thewait staff were allwomen, and Inoticed
with astart that they allbore some resemblance to
Cyrene. Warning bells went offinmyhead as Itried to
explain away thecoincidence, but nomatter howmany
times Ilooked down atthetable andthen back upatthe
waitresses, Isaw that they all had very similar
hairstyles with strongly bleached ends.
"What isgoing onhere?" Iasked, somewhat too
directly forpoliteness. "Imean, they alllook like you.
Isthisyour families place?"
Cyrene looked upatmeandsmiled, gesturing toward
thekitchen doors. "Look. Ourfood iscoming already!"
Iturned andsawthat this indeed wasthecase, but
still Icould notshake thefeeling that something was
terribly amiss. Inthecorner ofmyeye Inoticed that
allofthecreatures hadslowed their motions except for
thesharks, which were moving incloser. Iwasbecoming
very frightened, butagain Iheard Cyrene 'svoice, andmy
focus wasdirected ather.
"Come on.Eat, eat!! That's whywecame, isn't it!"
Sheheld upasuperbly prepared prawn coated with
rare andexpensive spices. Ilooked down attheplate of
food which hadbeen placed before me.Without question,
the chefs were first rate. Ihadnever seen seafood
prepared sowell. Mymouth started towater as Ireached
fortheprawn that Cyrene held out. AsItook it, Icould
nothelp butnotice themotion, orlack thereof, ofthe
sea-life outside ofthe windows. Iwas shocked and
somewhat horrified tosee that all ofthe fish had
stopped swimming, andthat they allhadturned toward me.
Ifelt asthough Imust begoing crazy, foritcertainly
didseem asthough every fish intheseawaswatching mo.
Was this possible? The sharks were nowmoving more
aggressively then ever.
"Eat... eat..." Cyrono repeated, tiervoice awhisper
trmuafar.
Iheld tlieprawn uptomylips andopened mymouth.
Yen, ttwas true, thespices were extraordinary. The
scent drove memadwith hunger. Iplaced theprawn into
mymouth...
but Icould notbring myself tochew.
Itstruck mewith theforce ofallthewaves inall
theseven seas. Howcould Isithere inthemidst ofthis
Neptunian garden, and all ofitsamazing varieties of
life, andthen eatwhat layhere before me? Howcould I
dothis? Icould not. Ithrew the prawn back onto my
plate.

"Ican't eatthis. Anyof it..."
Ilooked upatCyrene andshewassmiling again. A
brief sparkle lit upher eyes until they were like
emeralds, andsheleaned upover thetable andkissed me
softly onthelips.
"Thank you.." shewhispered.
Icannot saythat her kiss was akiss that I
enjoyed, because atthemoment shekissed me Ibecame
aware elherinner nature. Herbreath, like herheart,
wascold andmerciless. Alook ofurgency appeared onher
face.
"(let out. ofhere. Now." There wasnotrifling in
hervoice ashereyes scanned nervously toward thesharks
who nowwore riqht outside thewindows. Istarted to
rise, but not fust enough apparently, asCyrene warned me
again.
"There isno I ime .(let out."
Interestingly, she kept hervoice lowenough that
nooneelse could hear her. 1followed hergaze outthe
window, andalmost fell back when Isawwhat shewas
watching. Thegray whales hadagain begun tomove, but
this time they were swimming through the coral reef
toward thewindows.
Istumbled outofmyseat, knocking mychair over
intheprocess, anddashed toward thestairs and the
exit. Halfway across theroom Istopped andlooked back.
Cyrene wasstill seated, anditwasclear tomethat she
hadnointention ofleaving. Thefirst whale wasjust
outside ofthewindow, and Ileapt upthestairs through
theportal just asthe 'host' wasslamming itshut. I
landed awkwardly as Iheard thewindows smashing below.
Thehost slammed theportal door shut andlocked it,
looking back with acruel grin.
"You don't know howlucky you are..." shesaid, as I
jumped tomyfeet andstarted toward thefront door.
AsIleft that awful place attheedge ofthesea I
turned back andwasable toseedown through theportal
window into therestaurant. Tospeak ofwhat Isaw in
that instant still makes meshake sobadly that Ican
hardly write with anylegibility. What Isaw inthose
next fewmoments hasdriven metothebottle andall
manner ofself-destructing vices. What Isaw inthose
moments has driven meall but insane and still may
someday claim my life... but Ifeel asthough itis
imperative that Ishare itwith you.
The restaurant was rapidly filling with water,
already itwasdeep enough tocover allbutthetallest
intheroom. Thewaitresses hadgrabbed thealltooreal
tridents from thehands ofthestatues, andthey swam
90through that water with graceful lethality. Allaround
panicked people were desperately trying toruntoward the
stairway, butmost were being cutdown inturn bythe
trident wielding women, whostabbed them asthough they
were trout inastream. Blood filled thewater andthis
attracted the already ravenous sharks, who swum in
through thebroken windows andbegan tofeast onthe
atill living whowere inmany cases pinned inplace by
tridents. Thesharks fedoneveryone. Nomercy wasshown
toman, woman, orchild. Afewofthemore resourceful
victims made itupthestairs, only tofind theportal
locked. Icanstill seetheir faces tothis day... hands
clawing atthewindows, voices panicked, screams ofsheer
terror.
Thehost made noattempt tounlock theportal; she
merely smiled asthewater rose upthestairwell. Icould
notwatch then, forwith thewater came thesharks. I
turned andranoutoftherestaurant tomycar.
Looking back, itmight have been better tohave
died. Mylife isashambles. Idrink allday, andspend
whatever money Thave onpassing pleasures. Ihave lost
nilofmyfriends, frying toconvince them that mystory

Neptune's Harlot waswritten easily, with the
words flowing outoftheauthor. Itwas asifhis
typing hands were being controlled by his

ofastory just pouring forth from outoftheir
mind ;this isavirtually certain sign theliterary
work is amagickal creation overflowing with
embedded spirits.
Only themost obvious oftheembedded spirits
were highlighted. There are many more spirits
embedded within; some ofwhich cannot bereferred to
directly. Atbest these non-apparent spirits canbe
alluded tobyathorough comprehension ofcertain

•>//n/ I'll Root Symbols Evident inMultiple Works
Ctt'iitod byDltlerent Artists atDifferent Times
undet Pltloimt Circumstances
IfaLearn ofscholars were toattempt astudy
ofallhuman arlisLic creation throughout history,
they would very likely come to astaggering
conclusion. Thescholars would discover similar root
symbols are evident inmultiple works ofart,
created bydifferent artists atdifferent times,
under entirely different circumstances. Apainting
drawn intheyear 2002 C.E. intheUnited States of
America might have embedded within itthe same
symbol asapainting drawn intheyear 400B.C. in
ancient China. Anovel written intheyear 1970
might contain acharacter very similar toapersona
found inanovel written inthe year 1940. A
painting drawn inthe year 200 ontheAfrican
continent might contain anearly identical symbol to
thesymbol represented byacharacter inaliterary
novel written in1960 England. Inallofthese cases
none oftheartists would have hadanycontact with
theother artist's work.
Since symbols arerepresentations ofmemeticstructures orspirits, twosymbols canre-present
the same spirit though they may have different
physical appearances. Forexample, assume wehave a
spirit named Spirit X.Attempting tokeep things
simple, wewill assume Spirit Xcontains the
following qualities:
94Qualities ofSpirit X
1)Alove ofthecolor green.
2)Alove ofwarfare.
3)Thespirit isembodied byaplant.
Apainter evoking Spirit Xintheyear 200
A.D. intheheart oftheAmazon jungle might draw a
green vine shaped like avegetable spear, being
clutched inthe hands of 'awarrior. This vine
possesses alloftheessential qualities ofSpirit
X,soitisaperfectly valid representation or
manifestation ofSpirit X.Twothousand years later
apainter inFrance might draw agreen grape vine,
shaped like asword, being wielded byasoldier.
This would again beavalid representation ofSpirit
X, for itpossesses all of its essential
characteristics. Theactual physical manifestations
ofthe spirit aredifferent, but they areboth
symbols ofthesame underlying reality. Theartist
inFrance might never have even heard ofChina,
while theChinese painter certainly could notsee
into thefuture. Howisitthen that both painters
could possibly have drawn thesame symbol ifthey
had not both evoked the same spirit? The

Any magician who develops the ability to

Evoking asufficient number ofastral entities and
images allows amagician tomap orconstruct a
blueprint o(theastral plane.
Within the astral plane iscontained the
collective uiconscious andtheHall ofRecords. In
addition, theastral plane contains arecord of
events before they occur onthematerial plane. The
astral plane canbeseen asavast plane containing
therawmaterial outofwhich material reality is
formed. Every possible manifestation ofmaterial
reality iscontained within theastral plane. Most
ofthese possible manifestations donotsolidify
into material reality, but asmall percentage of
possible manifestations do form our tangible
material reality.

addition, since theastral plane iscomposed ofa
matrix ofallpossible events which could manifest
inthematerial plane, correct evocation through the
uncovering ofthecorrect embedded symbols could
evoke images ofevents before they happened. A

interchangeable. That is,elements from anyoneform

shall bediscussed the magickal technology of
importing anytype ofartistic endeavor into the
process ofwilled automatic drawing toachieve
98 Memetic Magic 99


evocation ofunrevealed portions of lheastral-daemonic plane.
Assume that anevocation of Ihespiritunderlying afamous literary work wan desired.Perhaps amagician wanted toevoke!hespiritassociated with thefamous literary work Dtncula.
Famous literary works often become famous preciselybecause they contain archetypal element ;iwhich standthetest oftime. Themagician would then read thework inquestion. Intheprocess ofreading theliterature asmany embedded spirits nspuss 1trieshould beuncovered andrecorded. When finished, thelist should beshortened toamanageable number ofembedded spirits which would then beused as fheframework ofamagickal evocation.
The actual magickal technology utilized toperform theevocation should bewilled .nil oin.il Icdrawing. Thenecessary materials should begatheredfor awilled automatic drawing ritual. Then thetransference oftheliterary symbols should bemsde
onto thedrawing paper. Inother words, theembeddedspirits uncovered from theliterary worK could betransferred directly from thelist tocreate theframework oftheautomatic drawing. For instance,theembedded spirit list might read something like
this:
Embedded Spirit List fortheNovel Dracula
~~>Character Dracula:
Vampire, Rich, Noble, Able toChange Form, Able toHypnotize Women with HisSexual Charm
—>Character Renfield:
Insane, Servant ofDracula, Confined toaMenl a IInstitution

Wild, Remote, Dark, Filled with Supern.itui.ilForces, Packs ofWolves Howling
>Setting London England:
Cosmopolitan, Sophisticated, Location where Draculaseems outofplace
Manipulation oftheRoot Social Matrix&theFabric ofReality too—>Etc.
Theindividual elements ofthelist should be
written directly onto thedrawing paper onwhich the
evocation istotake place. These elements canbe
placed anywhere onthepaper aslong assufficient
empty space remains into which theautomatic drawing
will bedrawn. Then, while theconscious mind is
concentrating ontheframework ofthepicture, the
hidden orunrevealed location ,entity, oraspect of
theliterature isevoked (drawn) through theprocess
ofautomatic drawing into theempty space within the
framework.
While such direct transference of the
individual elements ofaspirit list will often lead
toaworking evocation, more successful evocations
can behad ifalittle more sophistication is
utilized inthe transference ofthe individual
elements contained within thespirit list tothe
drawing.
Themore abstract there-presentations ofthe
Individual elements ofthespirit list, themore
powerful theevocation caused byconscious attention
onsuch symbols become. Iftheframework ofthe
automatic drawing issymbolic itself, itstands a
better chance ofpenetrating thedefenses ofthe
conscious mind, therefore strongly influencing the
form oftheastral element tobeevoked.
Accordingly, theindividual elements ofthe
spirit list should first betransformed into
symbolic re-presentations oftheir individual forms.
Themost effective method would betoperform a
willed automatic drawing utilizing each individual
element ofthespirit list oneelement atatime to
receive evoked symbolic ro-presentations oftheir
original literary forms. These numerous singular
evoked manifestations oftheindividual elements of
theoriginal embedded spirit list would then be
transferred asisonto thepaper onto which the
actual evocation oftheroot symbol underlying the
entire literary work istobeperformed. Insimpler
terms, each embedded spirit discovered within the
original literary work should itself betransformed
into anevoked symbol, andwhen finished, allof
Memetic Magic 101


Lhese symbols should beused tolorm Urnrrnm*work
forfinal evocation.
Butduetotime constraints such n Ihorouqhiy

represent their literary forms. Thes« ihumc loualy
(asopposed toosubconsciously inthemote thorough
ritual) created symbols canthen betransferred onto
the ritual paper tocreate the framework within
which theautomatic drawing evocation will take
place.
Forinstance, theindividual elements ofthe
embedded spirit list could beconsciously sketched,
converted into memetic molecules, ors igi II'.'.«d, and

Thevery same principals could beimplemented

would form theframework ofanautomatic drawing.
Thespirit orportion oftheastral plane evoked

Developing theEyes
Theability toseethememetic manifestations
OftheRoot Social Matrix isthefoundation upon
which Memetic Magick isbuilt. Anytrue practice of
memetic sorcery assumed themagician first develops
theeyes with which .toseetheRoot Social Matrix.
IftheRoot Social Matrix istobemanipulated
efficiently itmust first beseen. Aritual with the
power toopen thesocial eyes isincluded attheend
ofthis book. TheRoot Social Matrix cannot beseen
assuch bythebiological eyes, though hints ofits
presence abound within themedium ofthe five
senses. The Root Social Matrix isseen asan
intuitive understanding ofthe root causes and
connotations ofsociocultural events. Aproper
understanding ofmemetic theory accelerates this
process ofintuitive understanding.
Since human sociocultural systems contain many
illusory structures which distort, hide, andconceal
true nature togain advantage, real orimaginary,
over competing portions ofsociety andculture, very
fewhuman beings have theability toperceive the
root truths concealed beneath the veil of
sociocultural illusion.
OftheOpening oftheEyes, contained within
thepractice portion ofthis book, isapowerful
ritual. Ifenacted faithfully. OftheOpening ofthe
Eyes will allow some measure ofsight into theRoot
Social Matrix. Thepower extracted from successful
enactment oftheritual will vary inaccordance with
the relative strength ofnegative sociocultural
programming inherent inthemagician, combined with
natural ability toseeinto theRoot Social Matrix.
Itmaybethat onrare occasions individuals are
born natural seers. These rare individuals have an
innate genetic biological ability tosee past
sociocultural illusion totheheart oftheRoot
Social Matrix. Butthenumber ofnatural seers in
anypopulation will bevery small, perhaps nomore
than onemanorwoman inahundred thousand.
Memetic Magic 105


IftheOftheOpening oftheEyes ritual turns
outnottobeassuccessful asonewould like, itis
afairly simple matter toalter the individual
components oftheritual tostrengthen orblunt its
power once theprincipals underlying theformula are
grasped.
TheOftheOpening oftheEyes ritual derives
itspower from some fairly simple principals. It
assumes (correctly) that anyhuman being residing
within amodern social matrix (anation, city, or
social group ofanykind) will beprogrammed toa
large extent byhisorhersociocultural upbringing
andsurroundings. Though most ofusconsider our
thoughts tobeour own, inreality most ofour
thoughts (andtherefore most ofouractions) arethe
result ofsociocultural memetic programming which
hasinfected ourminds. Therefore, deprogramming is
the first step towards developing the eyes with
which theroot ofsociety andculture canbeseen.
The programming infecting our minds forms the
framework ofourconsciousness. Inmost cases this
programming will repel theassembly level symbolic
language ofthe undistorted Root Social Matrix
before itisallowed tointeract inanymeaningful
waywith thethinking portion oftheconsciousness.
Itdoes notmatter howvehemently anindividual may
desire toseetheRoot Social Matrix iftheir mind
isunable toaccept itssymbols.
Sociocultural programming will fade tosome
degree with time. Memetic structures most be
constantly reinforced orthey lose potency. Modern
society does anexcellent jobofreinforcing the
programming itcreates. Therefore, deprogramming is
thenatural result ofisolation from sociocultural
systems. Effective isolation isthekeytoeffective
deprogramming. Those whowish todevelop the eyes
should cutthemselves offfrom allmanifestations of
sociocultural programming. Sociocultural programming
istransmitted viatelevision, movies, newspapers,
friends, family, etc. Anycontact with theoutside
world will settheindividual back intheir quest,
andmayeven destroy thepower oftheentire ritual.
Inmany cases, ifthe initial programming is
exceptionally potent, itneed only bereinforced by
slight contact with theRoot Social Matrix toremain
106potent. TheRoot Social Matrix canbevisualized as
anatmospheric medium saturated with memetic
contaminants andthought viruses; simple exposure
runs thereal risk ofcontamination.
Isolation from sociocultural structures over
anextended period oftime should give birth toa
noticeable ability tosee into the Root Social
Matrix. Anyfailure islikely attributable toalack
ofeffective isolation. The ritual should be
repeated with real concern forthemaintenance of
theisolation state. Incontrast, ifthe ritual
proves toopotent foranindividual's taste, the
degree ofisolation canbealtered totone down the
extent ofdeprogramming.
But simple deprogramming isnot enough;
eventually onewill beforced toreenter theRoot
Social Matrix, andimmediately upon sodoing will be
bombarded byforeign programming, which, ifallowed
tobypass mental defenses, will pull theveil of
illusion back down over theworld. Reprogramming
must occur atthemoment anindividual ismost clear
offoreign programming inorder tomaintain theeyos
upon reemergence into theRoot Social Matrix.
It ispractically impossible toremain
completely immune toforeign programming, butwith
vigilance theeyes canbemaintained atalevel
whereby thehidden influences ofsociety andculture
canbeseen, andmost thought andaction will be
self-determined.
Becoming theIdeal Type
Ideal types are the dominant memetic
structures within any sociocultural system. An
individual needs todevelop thepower toraise an
idea orcultural artifact tothelevel oftheideal
type within micro social systems, forinsodoing
theprincipals necessary toraise tothelevel of
theideal type inmacro social systems arelearned.
Becoming the ideal type does notnecessarily
mean taking theguise ofthecurrent ideal type. In
other words, tobecome anideal type itisnot
necessary tomimic thecomposition ofthecurrent
ideal type. Ifyouwant tobecome thenext Kobe
Bryant, youdonotnecessarily have tobecome aKobe
Bryant clone. Infact, though such anapproach is
Memetic Magic Manipulation oftheRoot Social Matrix&theFabric ofReality 107


possible, itisnotthedesired route. Rather, any
attempt should aim toraise anindividual tothe
level ofthecurrent ideal type, thereby becoming
thenewideal type, without particular regard tothe
composition ofthe ideal type which istobe
replaced.
Tothe uninitiated, ideal types appear as
static realities. That is, acurrent ideal type
appears asanunalterable social law. But this
appearance isanillusion serving tosupport the
power ofthecurrent ideal type. Inreality, ideal
types arematters ofposition within theRoot Social
Matrix; whoever orwhatever holds the correct
position within theRoot Social Matrix becomes the
newideal type.
Forexample, thedominant social meme among
theyouth ofAmerica might be->rap isthecoolest
form ofmusic<- .Totheuninitiated this might
appear asastatic truth, i.e. rapwill always be
thehippest music andanymusic which isnotrap
cannot bethecoolest music. Anyone whoholds such
beliefs would beunder thepower oftherapmusic
ideal type dominant meme. But, ifinfive years a
newvariety ofmusic, which inthis case will be
fictitiously labeled ->Future Jazz<-,. rises to
become thedominant meme among theyouth ofAmerica,
itwill become thenewideal type representing the
coolest music, which again will beseen asan
unalterable social lawbytheuninitiated.
Ideal types arenotbased upon social truth,
except inthesense that thepower they hold over
themasses isreal. Ideal types arenever static;
though they canhold power for aslong asthe
memetic structure ofwhich they arecreated can
dominate the sociocultural sphere. But it is
absolutely essential tounderstand that ideal types
arenotstatic truths orlaws, they canalways be
changed byproper manipulation ofthefabric ofthe
Root Social Matrix. Such anunderstanding is
essential ifanindividual wishes tomake major
changes intheRoot Social Matrix. Even themost
entrenched ideas canbeuprooted andreplaced bynew
ideas. Forexample, ifaMemetic Magician properly
manipulated theRoot Social Matrix, hecould cause
United States society tobelieve thatmanly menwore
Manipulation oftheRoot Social Matrix&theFabric ofReality 108pink orwomanly women wore blue, orshort players
were most suited toplay center onbasketball teams.
These aresome rather innocuous examples, butwhen
taken toextremes itshould quickly benoted how
much power over society anindividual would have if
apowerful ideal type could bedethroned and
replaced with afashioned ideal type. Thedominant
religion orpolitical structure inanysociety isno
more than afirmly entrenched ideal type (afirmly
entrenched dominant meme),and allideal types can
bechanged.
Anindividual with thepower toraise objects
(whether ideals, thought viruses, orcultural
artifacts) tothelevel ofanideal type hasthe
power totransform societies, nations, andtherefore
theworld, according towill.
Memetic Magickal Grand Works
Herein shall bedescribed thefour Grand Works
ofgreater Memetic Magick. Abrief study ofhistory
will reveal that historical figures have, onrare
occasions, accomplished atleast thefirst three of
theworks listed. Such historic occasions have led
totremendous alteration inhuman sociocultural
systems which noticeably affected thelives ofall
human beings. The four Grand Works ofgreater
Memetic Magick are listed inorder oftheir
importance.
Grand Work #2; Self-Evolution through the
Creation ofand Immersion into the Proper
Sociocultural Matrix
Thefirst Memetic Magickal grand work isnota
Grand Work assuch. But itislisted within the
Grand Works subsection because itisthe single
absolutely essential work without which none ofthe
other works arepossible.
Self-Evolution through the creation ofand
immersion into theproper sociocultural conditions
can lead to self-evolution far beyond the
development ofthe eyes, ifthe same general
principals underlying theritual OftheOpening of
theEyes areapplied andmanipulated correctly to
sociocultural matrixes asawhole. Since conscious
minds areprimarily memetic creations, spontaneous
Memetic Magic 109


evolution cunbnaffected inanydesired direction
bythe crunt Ionofandimmersion into theproper
sociocultural conditions. This immersion isenacted
inthehnpn Ihebombarding memetic structures will
bind to thncurrent mental memetic framework and
cause thndesired mental changes within the
subconnc Iounmind, which would inturn cause the
planned alterations inthe conscious mind, and
therea 11nrInaction.
Ii'r.imi Work #2:TheTransformation ofaMacro-
Scale Human Society (ANation) Through Proper
Manipulation oftheRoot Social Matrix
TheRoot Social Matrix isinexorably tied to
human social andcultural conditions. Thus, macro-
scale transformation within human societies isa
valid concept..
Achieving adesired end is amatter of
releasing thecorrect complex memetic structures at
thecorrect positions within theRoot Social Matrix.
Anindividual should useoccult knowledge ofthe
workings oftheRoot Social Matrix tor.ise tothe
correct position ofpower andinfluence within a
nation, andfrom that position release theproper
memetic structures into thesociocultural system.
These memetic structures (most likely thought
viruses) would then infect the citizens ofthe
nation andcause them toactinaccordance with the
will. Theactions oftheinfected populace would
likely form new ormodified sociocultural and
political institutions which would tend towards
stabilizing thecreated changes through time and
generations.
This process will bedescribed inanoverly
simplistic manner notmeant tobetaken asaviable
plan forexecuting thesecond grand work, but it
should allow thereader aclearer comprehension of
theconcept which isbeing discussed.
Under normal circumstances arise topower and
influence within anation would beimpossible dueto
mental conditioning imposed bythemasses upon the
citizens ofthenation inwhich the individual
inhabits. Butsuch arise becomes possible when the
individual develops theeyes with which toseethe
Root Social Matrix. Intheprocess ofdeveloping the
110eyes deprogramming andseparation from theideology
ofthemasses occurs, allowing effective action
based on avalid comprehension ofprevailing
sociocultural conditions.
Using memetic magick, artistic memetic magick,
recognition ofandability tobypass impossibility
walls, resistance ofcontrol fields, andabove all
willed self-determination freed from thecontrolling
memetic influence anindividual climbs toaposition
ofprominence.
Let usassume anindividual raised himself
from school teacher toPresident oftheUnited
States .Theindividual would have managed tomove
into theproper position within theRoot Social
Matrix wherein willfully fashioned thought viruses
maybereleased likely toreshape thenation.
This isavery general description notmeant
asanexact blueprint; itmayvery well bethecase
that another position within society would need to
bemoved into inorder formore effective enactment
ofdesired changes; perhaps itwould benecessary to
become thehead ofalarge corporation, atelevision
talk show host, orasports star. Theappropriate
forms ofthe complex memetic structures tobe
released into society depend upon thechanges tobe
caused andthecurrent structure oftheminds which
aretobeinfected.
Grand Work #3:Immortality through the
Creation ofaComplex Memetic Structure Capable of
Replicating Elements oftheIndividual Consciousness
into theMinds ofOthers Passed into theInfinite
Future
Aform ofimmortality canbeachieved ifthe
individual consciousness (or aportion thereof) can
bereplicated into theminds ofother conscious-
possessing organisms. These organisms would then
pass the replicated portion ofthe individual
consciousness tofuture generations.
Theexistence ofnemes allows thepossibility
ofimmortality ofmind. Itverymaywell bethat all
modern human beings arethehosts ofsomeunrealized
portion ofsome ancient sorcerer' sconsciousness
stretching outtowards ayearned forimmortality. A
strong case canbemade that thefounders ofthe
Memetic Magic Manipulation oftheRoot Social Matrix&theFabric ofReality 111


major religions mayhave been attempting torealize
immortality fortheir conscious minds through the
creation ofreligiosocial structures.
Any attempted transference ofconsciousness
into themind ofanother would necessarily involve
self-replicating complex memetic structures, or
thought viruses. Since large portions ofthehuman
consciousness aredirect memetic constructs, these
constructs oftheconscious mind could bereplicated
into other minds ifpackaged asaninstruction
mechanism within athought virus. Ifapotent
thought virus were tobeengineered, itcould then
bereleased into theRoot Social Matrix. Ifthe
virus were able toreplicate into just onenewmind
ineach generation itcould theoretically extend out
into theinfinite future, orreplicate until such a
time ashumanity asawhole became extinct. Buteven
ifthehuman race were togoextinct sometime inthe
future it would not necessarily mean the
consciousness would disappear. Any being which
contained amemetically created consciousness could
become infected with the thought virus; beit
animal, alien, ortrans-dimensional being. Ifany
other type ofbeing managed tobecome infected it
could then carry and pass thevirus tofuture
generations. Inaddition, aslong asanyculturally
created material artifact survived (book, computer
disk, statue, etc.) inwhich was embedded the
replicating consciousness; this material artifact
could infect aconsciousness with which itmight
come into contact atalater date.
Aninteresting possible manner inwhich the
immortality ofmemetic consciousness might be
affected would bevia the creation ofaself-
reproducing race ofconsciousness -bearing beings. An
example ofsuch beings might beelectro-mechanical
robots. Into thecomputerized processors (theminds)
ofthe robots would bedownloaded the complex
memetic structure representing the replicating
consciousness, which would then befaithfully
programmatically reproduced into generations to
come. Theadvantages ofsuch amethod would be
numerous; programmatically controlled robots could
beprogrammed toreproduce exact copies ofthe
complex memetic structure into future generations
112without the necessity ofovercoming competing
influences from theRoot Social Matrix.
Grand Work #4: Initiation of Human
Transcendental Evolution through Proper Manipulation
oftheRoot Social Matrix
Thehuman species could theoretically survive
forever, iftheuniverse which weinhabit were to
last infinitely. Butitappears weinhabit afinite
universe. Adaywill come when ouruniverse will
pass, and with the passing ofthe universe
necessarily comes thepassing ofhumanity. Soit
seems that any form ofgreater transcendental
evolution would involve theability totranscend our
universe anditslaws. This suggests avariety of
spiritual transcendence.
Buteven transcendental evolution onamuch
smaller scale could make life considerably better
both forhumanity andthevarious beings which share
this universe with humanity. Perhaps onedayhuman
beings will transcend toapoint where wewill no
longer attempt tomentally enslave each other and
physically enslave thevarious species with whom we
share this Earth.
Spontaneous transcendental evolution would
likely involve aprocess very similar toindividual
andnational evolution, only onalarger scale.
First theRoot Social Matrix would have tobeshaped
sothat itfit aparticular consciously engineered
form. Ofcourse, this would benosimple task, for
theshaping oftheRoot Social Matrix would include
thewilled manipulation oftheentire conglomeration
ofthe totality ofhuman sociocultural, and
therefore political andartistic forces.
Then thehuman race asawhole would have to
bemoved into thecorrect position within thenewly
formed Root Social Matrix. This would involve the
willed orforced direction ofhuman action which
would lead every human being into the correct
location within thenewly fashioned Root Social
Matrix, wherein theoretically thehuman race asa
whole would transcendentally evolve inthedesired

TheNeed foraPersonal Linguistic System
The modern human conscious mind utilizes
primarily linguistic symbolic terms tothink. Though
occasionally thoughts canbeseen asmental images,
orassymbols unrelated tolinguistic systems, for
allpractical purposes human beings exist within
culturally created linguistic frameworks. Thought
leads toaction; therefore, language serves both to
limit anddefine ourpossible range ofaction. Since
allmacro-scale human linguistic systems (such as
English, French, Spanish, Latin, etc.) are
sociocultural creations, thought itself enslaves
those who think utilizing culturally created
symbols. Macro-scale human language systems setvery
real limits onpossible thought patterns, and
therefore onpossible action.
Certainly macro-scale language systems confer
certain advantages upon those whoutilize them. This
book, for instance, iswritten inthe English
language system. Therefore, macro-scale linguistic
systems canbeused notonly tocommunicate with
other human beings, butalso asamental foundation
upon which totranscend human linguistic thought by
symbolic analogy. For the evolved being,
sociocultural language systems are ameans toan
ends, notanendinthemselves. Inorder topossess
truly free thought, anindividual needs tothink
utilizing hisownpersonal linguistic system.
Optimally, macro-scale human linguistic
systems should beutilized forcommunication with
themasses, while apersonal micro-scale linguistic
system should beused forpersonal thought. Inother
words, anindividual should create apersonal
magickal language and use this language for
thinking. Ifcommunication with others isnecessary
thepersonal language ofthemagician should be
translated into the appropriate macro-scale
linguistic symbol andspoken orwritten. Think in
your personal language, andcommunicate with the
sociocultural language utilized within aparticular
social matrix.

Manipulation oftheRoot Social Matrix&theFabric ofReality 116Memetic Mythological Interpretation
Within thefabric oftheRoot Social Matrix
root meanings canbeseen asthefoundations behind
the sociocultural structures inherent inhuman
societies. Often these root meanings will not
correspond totheunderstandings ofthemasses (the
uninitiated) .Infact, the memetic programming
dominating theminds oftheuninitiated will force
themasses toattack anyideas notconsistent with
that programming; thereby theuninitiated become the
mindless enforcers maintaining thecurrent social
structure. Cultural conformist attacks can range
from passive avoidance orridicule allthewayto
violent assault. Thus, though anenlightened
individual may oome tocomprehend theroot meaning
behind aportion oftheRoot Social Matrix, itis
often notwise toshare this knowledge with anyone
other than another seer.
Theuninitiated cannot accept anydeflnlt Ion
oftheinner meaning inherent ina.sociocultural
structure, regardless oftheform inwhich thetruth
ispresented. The language ofmemetic magic is
incompatible with the consciousness of the
uninitiated. Therefore, anyattempt toexplain the
truth behind events cannot, except invery rare
instances, lead theuninitiated toenlightenment. If
anenlightened individual, for whatever reason,
wishes toattempt tobring anuninitiated man or
woman toenlightenment inregards tothe root
meaning ofaparticular event, andhowitrelates to
theRoot Social Matrix, itwould befarwiser to
first attempt torearrange thememetic structure
underlying the consciousness ofthe uninitiated
individual. By so doing, the uninitiated
individual's hardware or consciousness is
transformed toaccept thesoftware which istobe
downloaded. Anuninitiated human cannever truly
understand anything regarding theRoot Social Matrix

Mythological systems areviewed bytheMemetic

Vampires
Oneofthemore fascinating andentertaining
mythological systems residing within theRoot Social
Matrix isthat ofthe vampire. While remaining
relatively stable formillennia, themyth ofthe
vampire hasevolved within thepast hundred years.
Manipulation oftheRoot Social Matrix&theFabric ofReality 118
dueprimarily totheinfluence ofpopular mod I<1
which accelerate thepace ofchange within theRoot
Social Matrix. Itisinteresting tonote how the
evolution ofthevampire myth hascoincided with the
evolution ofthespread ofmemes. Buteven given
this transformation oftheancient mythological form
thesymbols have remained consistent tothemodern
day. Before Iget into the root sociocultural
meaning ofthevampire myth Iwill first briefly
describe themyth itself.
Vampires are thought to be superhuman
creatures, immortal insome cases (especially inthe
more modern versions ofthe myth) andmortal in
others. Vampires arecreatures ofthenight unable
tosurvive under thelight ofthe sun, active by
night, hidden by day. Vampires absorb their
sustenance from human blood. Vampires could survive
offblood acquired inanyway, whether from animals
orwilling donators, buteven sothey prefer hunting
and taking blood from unwilling human victims.
Vampires areconsidered undead, ortheliving dead,
andoften rest incoffins orgraven during theday.
Vampires oast noreflect Ions Inmirrors, cannot,
enter hallowed ground (such anchurches ortemples),
andarerepelled byreligious symbols and icons.
Vampires reproduce byinfecting human beings with
their blood.
Though vampires are considered evil and
without souls, they fascinate usnonetheless with
their super human powers. Preternatural sensory
abilities, flying, shape shifting, great strength,
charisma, theability tohypnotize their victims;
these areallmythological powers ofthevampire.
Vampires terrify andfascinate usatthesame time.
What isitthat sofascinates people about vampires?
Toputtheanswer most simply, people areboth
fascinated and terrified ofvampires because
vampires doexist. Butvampires donotexist inthe
waymost people think they exist. Theexplanation of
howvampires canexist both exactly asstated, while
atthesame time remain unseen bytheuninitiated,
regards thesymbolism inherent inthemyths. The
symbols used todescribe vampires arethecorrect
symbols, but theminds oftheuninitiated cannot
read thesymbols asexact translations; before they

through (he fLiters ofmemetically f.irthloned minds.
Mythological symbolic l.ingumje can be
translated directly tothe const: Ioiimmaa, andthe
base reality underlying amyth seen.
Themyth ofthevampire can Liedeciphered asa
description, almost abiological classification, of
aspecies ofmeta orsub-humans (depending onyour
point ofview), existing within human pops Iations.
With nearly 6billion members olthehuman
species alive today, itwould befoolish toassume
that weareallthesame human animal. With each new
birth comes avery small chance ofmuLa IIonfrom the
standard human genotype. When thenumber ofhuman
births climbs into the billions, significant
biological mutations become amathematical
certainty. Inlacl, several sub-spec Iosofhuman
being exist; some arepowerful, some arenot. But
theeyes olthememetically controlled masses are
notprogrammed toseethese mutations among us;at
leasl not consciously. Closer tothe truth,
memo I Ica I Iycontrolled humans seek outandtryto
eliminate (either physically, mentally,
economically, orotherwise reduce rival power base
and potency) any diversity which threatens the
dominant gene pool. Mutated humans are not
recognized consciously forwhat they are; rather
they arelabeled with derogatory anddisempowering
terms. Memetic programming recognizes mutants for
what they are, butnever passes this information to
theconsciousness oftheuninitiated. Theenslaved
agent ofamemetic structure unknowingly serves asa
foot soldier ofsorts, protecting thesurvival not
ofthehuman organism, butofthememetic structure
inquestion. Most dominant memetic structures see
human mutants asvery real threats tothecurrent
gene pool, and instruct their enslaved hosts to
attack thethreatening mutants. This attack need not
bephysical; infact most attacks are not ofa
physical nature. Much more effective than violent
attacks are psychological, economic, orsocial
assaults.
But the vampire myth isonly indirectly
related tobiologically mutated human beings. The
vampire myth touches onamuch more prevalent and
Manipulation oftheRoot Social Matrix&theFabric ofReality 120effective form ofmutation; mental mutation, orthe
transformation andevolution ofconsciousness.
Itissufficient toclaim that vampires are ,i
sub-species ofHomo sapiens sapiens whohavepassed
through some kind ofinitiatory experience and
experienced spontaneous evolution ofconsciousness .
Ormore precisely, vampires are thesymbol the
masses have used throughout recorded history to
denote those whocanseeandmanipulate theRoot
Social Matrix.
Still not convinced? Let usexamine the
symbolic structure ofthevampire myth with aneye
toward itsrelevance tomemetic magic.
Vampires aresuperhuman creatures .What does
theword superhuman mean? Asuperhuman creature
would beacreature with amplified orimproved human
traits. That's also adefinition ofanevolved human
being. What isamemetic magician? Amemetic
magician isahuman whoevolves theability tosee
andmanipulate theRoot Social Matrix. Inorder to
seeandmanipulate astructure which cannot bosoon
ormanipulated bythecurrent, human-type, aprocess
ofspontaneous evolution ofconsciousness must
occur.
Thesuperhuman powers attributed tovampires
are symbolic ofamemetic magician's ability to
affect superhuman changes in sociocultural
environments.
Vampires are sometimes considered tobe
immortal .Until immortality inabiological sense in
discovered, theonly available mode ofimmortality
isthrough proper manipulation oftheRoot Social
Matrix. Oneofthegrand works ofmemetic magic is
theability tobecome immortal through aproper
manipulation ofthe Root Social Matrix. Ifthis
exceptionally powerful spell iscast correctly the
memetic life force ofthecasting individual is
transformed into such apotent thought virus
(fashioned memetic structure which reproduces
itself) that itsucceeds inreproducing itself in
every future ageunder anyprevailing sociocultural
conditions.
Memetic Magic 121


Vamp Lres are creatures of the darkness,
destroyed bythelight ofday. What thecontrolled
masses seeaslight, thememetic magician sees as
dark, and vice versa. Memetic maglcLans are
creatures ofthe darkness, atleast when viewed
through thedistorting lens oftheprevalent created
consciousness ofthe masses. Amemetic magician
exposed tothelight ofday (theprevalent memetic
programming) would bevanquished, forthepower ofa
memetic magician rests intheability torepulse
mentally enslaving memetic programming. Amemetic
magician canonly manipulate theRoot Social Matrix
directly when the consciousness provides the
framework necessary toaccept the root data
underlying thestructure oftheRoot Social Matrix.
Anymemetic programming which alters thenecessary
structuring oftheconsciousness toreceive thedata
inherent intheRoot Social Matrix will drain the
power ofamemetic magician.
Vampires feed onhuman blood. Human blood canbe
understood asasymbolic representation ofhuman
life force, ortheroot creations ofmodern human
beings. Astheblood isaroot force created bythe
human body tosustain life, human creations arethe
root force created byhumans tosustain culture.
Evolved magicians utilize thepower they obtain
through manipulation ofthe unseen Root Social
Matrix totake from, ordrain, thelifeblood ofthe
modern human animal. Anydraining ofthelife blood
ofthepeople could also beseen asdraining from
human culture.
Vampires aretheundead, ortheliving dead
Theprogramming which controls theminds of
theuninitiated causes theuninitiated toview only
humans similar tothemselves astruly alive. The
memetically controlled masses share certain
sociocultural similarities bynecessity. Since the
programs which control theminds oftheuninitiated
arevery strong symbiotic memes, theactions and
sociocultural preferences oftheuninitiated will be
extremely uniform, except inregards tominute
levels ofacceptable nonconformity. Thus theonly
people whom theuninitiated will consider tobe
122alive, oractually participating intheactions of
society andculture, will beother members ofthe
uninitiated class.
Tothe eyes oftheuninitiated, amemetic
magician mayappear dead totheworld; that is,they
will notactwithin thesociocultural structures in
acceptable, ornoticeable, ways. Memetic magicians
will often shun traditional sociocultural
structures, norms, mores, rituals, andrights which
theuninitiated consider essential. Such avoidance
onthepart ofthememetic magician will likely be
due totheir understanding ofmany cultural
practices asnothing more than reprogramming events.
But amemetic magician need notappear dead to
the world. Infact, when manipulating the Root
Social Matrix itisoften essential toenter into
thewebofsociocultural structures controlling the
uninitiated. Butwhen amemetic magician enters into
thecontrolwebs andcontrolfields, itisdone with
aneyetoward willed manipulation. Insodoing, the
scorn and resistance ofthe masses will be
attracted, atleast until such atime asthe
operation issuccessful. Ihen thememetic magician
will have become theheart ofthepower structure,
andthemasses, whoworship power, will worship the
magician aswell.
Vampires arerepelled byreligious symbols and
icons
Religions are atroot memetic constructs.
Religions exist andgrow byprogramming potential
converts. Thus religious icons andsymbols represent
the power of memetic unification.
Memetic
unification istheforce behind thecohesion ofthe
masses; thus anyreligious symbol oricon represents
themasses. Memetic magicians arerepelled bythe
beliefs andsociocultural characteristics ofthe
masses. The entire memetic magical system is
designed toevolve ahuman above thesociocultural
programming ofthemasses. Memetic magicians are
truly elite; themasses bydefinition arenot. The
memetic magician looks upon the culture ofthe
masses with unabashed distaste.
Memetic MagicManipulation oftheRoot Social Matrix&theFabric ofReality123


Homo Sapiens Sapiens DominusVamp Lresreproduce byinted Inqhuman beings
with their blood
Just astheblood ofthemasmomrepresents the
memetic sociocultural traits oftheuninitiated, the
blood ofavampire represents thetraits ofthe
memetic magician. When amemetic magician infects an
uninitiated human with his blood, heineffect
transmits tothat human thetraits consistent with
thesociocultural reality ofthememetic magician.
Thus, avampire infecting ahuman with hisblood
symbolizes amemetic magician leading anuninitiated
human tothespontaneous evolution ofconsciousness,
whereby the newly initiated becomes capable of
seeing andmanipulating theRoot Social Matrix.
Anymythological system canbepenetrated by
eyes which canseetotheheart oftheRoot Social
Matrix. The programmed masses always fail to
comprehend the significance ofthe mythological
systems they maintain, but amemetic magician need
notbeprogrammatically constrained from seeing the
truth behind socially created illusion.
Since religious systems contain strong
mythological elements, the deeper truths (or
untruths) inherent inreligious systems can be
comprehended bythediscerning individual aswell.TheRoots otDomination
Homo sapions sapiens (modern human beings) are
born ashighly intelligent, socially programmable
animals. After anindeterminate length oftime
(probably between 1and 3years),immersion into the
Root Social Matrix (through anupbringing within a
human sociocultural system such asafamily) hasthe
effect oftransforming aHomo sapien sapien into an
animal-technological hybrid. Butthough anevolution
hasoccurred, itisessential tounderstand that
Homo sapiens sapiens have notyettranscended their
animal roots. Modern Homo sapiens sapiens are
essentially animals whohave been programmed through
immersion into theRoot Social Matrix tothink and
actinpredefined ways, which inturn allows each
individual Homo sapien sapien access toameasure of
the collective power of human sociocultural
creation. Thus, itappears that though modern humans
areborn Homo sapiens sapiens, anyprolonged contact
with human sociocultural systems triggers an
evolution into adistinct andheretofore unnamed
species. Iwill label this biological-technological
modern hybrid Homo sapiens sapiens dominus (HSSD).
HSSD aredistinct inthat they arecreated bymeans
ofspontaneous mental evolution .Though biologically
unchanged from their Homo sapiens sapiens ancestors,
HSSD have evolved aunigue socio-culturally created
andmaintained mind.
HSSD excel atdomination. Modern humans rule
theEarth because oftheir unmatched mastery of
ruthless domination tactics. Socomplete ishuman
domination ofthenatural world that, inpractical
terms, HSSD have nonatural enemies other than other
human beings.
Humans evolved into the supreme dominating
animals because domination works. Any successful
evolution isbydefinition anadaptation toa
specific setofenvironmental forces which allows
effective survival andreproduction ofaspecies.
Domination istheforce which hasallowed humans to
Manipulation oftheRoot Social Matrix&theFabric ofReality 124 Memetic Magic 125


rtfic'Hnd from themurky depths ofhistory tobecome
murders oftheworld. But, despite itsadvantages,
ItIsabsolutely essential tounderstand that
successful evolutions (such ashumanities evolution
into thedominating animal) signify nothing more
than effective survival andreproduction strategies
inahostile andever-changing world. Evolution does
notnecessarily correlate directly with positive
change.
Though domination mayhave served ourspecies
well inthe past, sociocultural, biological, and
environmental changes demand acorresponding
evolution into anew form. The law ofNature
dictates that human beings will beforced tostop
their dominating tendencies, either under the
guidance ofevolved leaders, orwhen ourspecies
annihilates itself. Domination istooeffective.
HSSD have dominated theplanet tosuch anextent
that they have nonatural enemies besides competing
HMND. H Ineetheanimal kingdom hasbeen effectively
dominated, HH.'JD bytheir nature turn their
dominating tendencies inonthemselves. HSSD are
akin toabiological experiment running rampant.
HSSD aresosuccessful within their environment that
their population isexploding exponentially, and
soon there will betoomany HSSD fortheenvironment
tomaintain. HSSD will either exhaust theresources
oftheEarth andslowly starve, orannihilate each
other andtheplanet inwarfare spawned from the
quest fordomination over oneanother. Humanity has
reached thecrossroads. Humans must either submit to
theforces ofevolution orbeswallowed upbythe
very system which allowed them torise to
preeminence.
Evolved human beings already exist, yetHSSD
areunable (without first clearing their minds of
negative programming) toseeevolved beings forwhat
they are. When aHSSD looks upon anevolved human,
hesees only athreat tohispersonal andcollective
power. Hesees ahuman whoneeds tobedominated;
else someday theevolved being mayrise inpower and
come todominate thedominator. HSSD constantly seek
threatening organisms andattempt todominate those
organisms. ButHSSD fail tocomprehend thebigger
picture; evolved human beings areonly threats to
Manipulation oftheRoot Social Matrix&theFabric ofRealitythose whoseek power attheexpense ofthe hum.itt
genus asawhole.
Benefits ofDomination
HSSD utilize domination tactics because they
work. HSSD employ domination tactics because they
have been memetically programmed todoso.Immediate
benefits canbewitnessed when domination tactics
areputinto play, reinforcing memetic programming.
99% ofthe modern human population responds
primarily tothedomination/submission cycle. HSSD
will dominate what they can, andsubmit tothat
which they cannot dominate. Anaverage HSSD
utilizing domination tactics will beable to
successfully dominate about 50% ofthose they
attempt todominate, following theprincipal that
50% ofhumans will notbeasstrong asanyone
average individual, and50%will bestronger.
Those who are dominated are ineffect
controlled by their dominator. Thus power,
privilege, respect, andwealth canbotaken from one
human byanother. This allows asuccesslul dominator
tohorde other human beings astools, taking a
disproportionate amount olwealth andpower from
those who have been dominated. The
domination/submission cycle iseasily visible within
traditional factory orbusiness settings. Numerous
workers, orthedominated, work hard for asingle
dominator, orbusiness owner. Theowner takes most
ofthewealth, while performing aminimal amount of
work. Insocial systems dominators horde notonly
power and wealth, but also the respect and
allegiance ofthose whom they dominate. Dominators
usethedominated assteps upon which toclimb to
power, wealth, respect, andprivilege.
When social systems governed by the
domination/submission cycle areexamined byamind
freed from negative memetic programming, inherent
problems with thedomination/submission cycle become
evident. Domination isaneffective tactic only for
the dominator. The dominated receive a
disproportionate amount ofbenefit (power and
wealth) within anydomination/submission cycle. But
neither thedominators northedominated feel that
the system isunjust. The dominated have been
126 Memetic Magic 127


proqrammed toview their position within thesocial
hierarchy asstatic. Due tonegative memetic
programming, thedominated tend totake pride in
their status asslaves. Thedominated will attempt
topull back down anyoftheir ownrank whomake an
effort torise within asocial structure. The
dominated ridicule andshun change andideas which
attack thecurrent dominant memetic structures.
HSSD have been programmed tobelieve that the
only way toacquire power, wealth, andstatus is
through thedomination ofeveryone andeverything
that canbedominated. HSSD think inabsolutely
selfish terms. They seenoinherent wrong inthe
acquirement ofpower, wealth, and status atthe
expense ofothers. HSSD aredivided into twosub-
species; dominators andcontrolbots. Dominators are
those who are successful within asociocultural
matrix with their domination tactics, while
control bolts arethose whoareunsuccessful, andthus
have been dominated. The difference between
dominators andconLrolbots isoneofdegree only;
any cont rolhot can become adominator ifhis
domination tactics are successful, while any
dominator canbecome acontrolbot ifhebecomes
dominated byanother. Thedomination ofothers is
Lireonly form ofsocial mobility open toaHSSD.
Oftentimes, anindividual maybeadominator within
onesociocultural matrix while concurrently serving
asacontrolbot inanother. Dominators tend to
believe, just astruly evolved humans do,that they
aretheelite ofsociety, andtherefore deserving of
whatever they cantake. Dominators believe theymust
dominate others, orothers will dominate them.
Dominators andtruly evolved humans are at
opposite ends oftheevolutionary spectrum. The
dominators are pulling the masses ofhumanity
towards enslavement andeventual extinction, while
truly evolved humans areattempting tolead the
masses tosurvival and abetter future. But,
unfortunately, due totheprogramming ofdominant
memes, dominators believe themselves tobetheelite
oftheworld, andthetruly evolved human beings tobethe dregs ofhumanity. This belief further
justifies theoppression ofthedominators towardthose human beings whohave truly evolved into lothim
capable ofleading humankind down autopian path.
ThePhilosophy ofDomination
Dominators believe itisabsolutely right to
take fromwhomever orwhatever canbetaken from, by
anymeans, atanycost, short ofthedemise ofthe
taker. Thegreater good inofnoconcern. Dominators
areconcerned only with tho Irownpower. They take
from whomever they can, and attack whoever or
whatever isseen asathroat .
Dominators and evolved beings actually
perceive the world differently. Dominators and
evolved beings give different meanings tothesame
terms. Dominators neeother human Doings asthreats
and potential viol lms. F.volvod beings son other
ahumans asbrothers andpotential allies. Dominators
search fortalent andpotential andruthlessly stamp
itout wherever found. Adominator does not see
potential forwhat ItIs; adominator sees potential
asanother word moaning lhio.it. Adominator isonly
concerned with personal power and Itsprotect Ionand
expansion. Kvolved beings seepotent lal torwhat it
is;talent tir.itcanboused tolurther theadvance
ofthe human race towards afuture utopia. A
dominator sees theworld through thelens ofthe
domination/submission cycle, while anevolved human
sees the world from apoint above the
domination/submission cycle, where thetrue needs of
thehuman race canbejudged much more effectively.
HSSD are theultimate technological animal.
Butevolved humans have discovered amethod which
utilizes their animal-technological nature as a
stepping stone from which torise completely above
theanimal kingdom and thedomination/submission
cycle.
Types ofDominators
Just asthere exists great diversity among
human beings and their talents, there isalso
considerable diversity among dominators. Competing
factions within HSSD attempt todominate and
eradicate one another. Some HSSD will utilize
straightforward domination tactics. Straightforward
domination tactics arethose most akin tothose seen
Manipulation oftheRoot Social Matrix&theFabric ofReality 128 Memetic Magic 129


within animal aoclal systems. HSSD utilizing such
tactics Imui to be loud, aggressive, and
overbearing/ gLving orders toothers andpunishing
those whodonotobey.
Others will attempt toconceal their true
goals andactions. They will deliberately deceive
potential victims. They will claim allegiance toa
certain setofideas, only toattempt toinfiltrate
anddestroy those ideas.
Some areinterested intaking power, while
others aremore inclined totrade for it.Some seek
massive numbers ofconverts, while others desire
only aselect fewservants. Some prefer tobevery
conspicuous when utilizing power, while others favor
concert I Irigpower behind control bots used aspuppets.
Anyattempt tolist, allofthesub-species of
doin Inalornandthetactics they utilize could easily
fill many books, forthere are asmany different
domination tactics asthere arepeople with ideas.
This incredible diversity has arisen through
ceaseless conflict amongst individual HSSD, and
amongst HSSD andtruly evolved beings. When one
tactic becomes toocommon, defenses areevolved by
those whom these tactics areused against. When
effective defenses are evolved, old domination
tactics become ineffective, andnewroutes ofattack
must bedevised, orthe dominator becomes the
dominated.
Fortunately, anevolved human being bypasses
the entire domination/submission cycle. Newly
evolved domination tactics canbevery effective
within theranks ofHSSD, whoarealready lost in
theseaofillusion, butevolved human beings have
learned torise tothesurface oftheseaandthus
.ire immune tochanges inthecurrent. Thekeyto
overcoming domination tactics isnottofall into
the dom in.it. ion/submission cycle. Donot try to
dominate others, anddonotsubmit todomination.
This isthewayofanevolved human being.
HSSD Culture
All ofusare familiar with HSSD culture.
Since human societies arecomprised anddominated
nearly wholly byHSSD, anyone wholives within human
Manipulation oftheRoot Social Matrix&theFabric ofReality 130societies will by imc*»B«ity have concentrated
contact with HSSD culture.
HSSD culture eelebratea the strong. It
celebrates aggressive notion, taking from others,
anddomination. Culture in•atrong transmitter of
programming. HS.'ll) programming attacks human minds
from every angle. Movlea, televi flion, radio, media,
communication, language, and body motions all
attempt toIrannmlt theculture ofthedominators
into themlndn ofthedominated. Moat people are
effectively programmed toanextent whore their
thoughts, andtherefore their actIons, arenottheir
own. Aconstant bombardment ofsociocultural symbols
serves toreinforce programming which would
otherwise weaken.
HSSD memetic programming isinvisible tothe
average human, butallonehastodotoseeitis
open their eyes. Signs ofHSSD areomnipresent
within anymodern sociocultural matrix. Movies are
filled with hidden messages which brainwash the
unwary. Movies andtelevision arethemost powerful
memetic programming devices ever created. The
programming ofentire populations canbeeffectively
achieved inashort period oftime. Asingle
blockbuster movie creates tens ofmillions of
controlbots, allthinking andacting inconformity.
Theaters are controlbot producing factories.
Television operates inthesame manner. Those who
watch themost television arethemost likely tobe
avid controlbots.
Signs oftheeffects ofHSSD areevident in
thedress and actions ofthemasses. Signs and
symbols which indicate strong memetic Influence are
called indicators. Anything from aparticular
hairstyle, aparticular fashion choice, tothewords
aperson speaks canbeindicators. Indicators change
astime passes, butthat which indicators point to
remains constant. Thus HSSD wear auniform which
distinguishes memetic slaves from thementally free.
Thestrongest controlbots tend todress themost
uniformly. Thewise manwill seeinthis trend the

human in amillion iscompletely free from the
influence ofthedominators. bond listmsthemselves
are inmost cases under theinfluence ofcontrol
fields aswell.
Without controlbots, the power of any
dominator would beseverely limited. Dominators
without controlbot slaves would belimited to
dominating those people with whom they haddaily
contact. Controlbots are thedominator' sservants
whose minds have been successfully programmed toact
within established boundaries dictated bysaid
dominator. These boundaries almost always include
enforcing asocial code, seeking out others
uninfected bythememe controlling theparticular
controlbot, andtransmitting theappropriate memetic
programming into uninfected minds. This standard
behavior canbecondensed into asimple formula;
controlbots Enforce/Seek/Infect.
True controlbots never seethemselves assuch.
While controlbots profess tobefree andraise the
banner ofrighteousness, they will beaggressively
transmitting theprogramming which controls their
psyches into theminds ofothers. This self-deceit
isanecessary component Inalldomination schemes,
forvery fewhuman beings would choose tobeslaves
ifthey actually understood themselves tobesuch.
Controlbots are predictable, but
extraordinarily dangerous if not spotted. A
controlbot who isnotspotted will transmit his
programming most effectively. Controlbots are
capable oftransmitting programming into theminds
ofunknowing victims, thereby converting those
unknowing victims into new controlbots who are
mirror images oftheoriginal. This newcontrolbot
Memetic Magic 133


will then begin actively seeking those whodonot
follow the tenets ofthe particular meme now
controlling hismind, with theintent ofinfecting
yet another unknowing victim. Inthis manner a
particular dominator' sideology canspread quickly
through asocial group, andeven anentire nation or
world.
Prevalence
Nearly every human being who has ever
inhabited theEarth could becorrectly labeled a
controlbot. This mayappear tobeanexaggerated
claim, but when considered after careful
observation, itmakes very good sense. Over ninety-
nine percent ofhuman beings alive today arefull
fledged controlbots. Oftheremaining onepercent,
most walk the precarious mental border between
freedom anddomination. Afierce mental battle rages
within theminds ofthese elite, pitting theforces
ofevolution against therelentless bombardment of
sociocultural programming.
Thesituation within theranks of.theelite
mirrors thesituation within thepublic asawhole.
Ninety-nine percent oftheelite are atwarwith
their ownminds. Theremaining onepercent have
successfully freed themselves completely from
sociocultural programming.
Using thepercentages asaguide, thevast
majority ofthose whopartake ofthis work will be
full-fledged controlbots. Ascontrolbots, they will
notbethemasters oftheir ownminds, though they
will believe themselves tobe. Thus thememetic
programming dominating theminds ofmost humans who
read this book will cause those minds toreject the
truth contained within. But afewamong those who
read this work will comprehend, tovarying degrees,
the truths contained within, depending onthe
strength ofthememetic programming dominating their
minds. Thefact that anindividual chooses toread
this work speaks well fortheir chances ofbreaking
free from sociocultural programming.
Anyone can awaken through struggle against
sociocultural memetic programming. Toawaken from
thedominator' sdream world isakin tobeing born
anew. Ninety-nine percent ofpeople born onthis
Manipulation oftheRoot Social Matrix&theFabric ofReality 134planet have never truly lived. Those enslaved by
memetic structures arc Like ghosts. Controlbots
exist, but can touch nothing, andmake noreal
changes.
Spotting
Controlbots are aspoolMrmental sub-species
ofHomo sapiens sapiens tUuulmis. Ahuman with a
programmed mind always shows signs, orindicators,
oftheir particular monl.il mold. Controlbots
dominate whatever they run, for this istheir
nature. Thus controlbots .ittempt todominate other
controlbots.
Though controlbots often fight. amongst
themselves, thevarious mental types ofcontrolbot
will ally with each other when anevolved human is
spotted. Controlbots seek first and foremost to
attack uninfected minds. Itisonly when noevolved
human ispresent that controlbots turn onone
another.
Upon spotting anevolved human, acontrolbot
will immediately seek toaggressively transmit
memetic programming into the evolved human's
uninfected mind. Transmission ofmemetic programming
into anuninfected mind amounts toareproduction
attempt. If the reproduction attempt is
unsuccessful, thecontrolbot will attempt todestroy
theevolved human being, utilizing whatever actions
areavailable within thesocial bounds controlling
thegiven situation. Thus, ifacontrolbot spots an
evolved human inapublic place, andisunsuccessful
inspreading itsprogramming, thecontrolbot would
then attempt todestroy the evolved human's
reputation, through humiliation, orany other
damaging social action, provided this action is
consistent with andcontained within theallowable
actions defined bythememetic structure controlling
thecontrolbots mind related tothecurrent social
situation. Aphysical attack inunlikely, forthis
would likely break social laws dominant memes donot
want broken. Akeytounderstanding andpredicting
theactions ofcontrolbots lies intherealization
that controlbots donotcontrol their ownminds, and
arethus notfree toinitiate their ownactions.

oftheir mental andphysical capabilities.

Tactics
Controlbot tactics canvary considerably. New
varieties ofcontrolbot arecreated every day, as
oldvarieties disappear. Though itcantake some
time tospot anattack oradomination attempt bya
controlbot, once aparticular tactic isperceived
andunderstood forwhat itis,thesame tactic will
beeasily spotted again inthe future, nomatter
which controlbot uses it.
Thestraightforward domination attempt isthe
basest, most animalistic tactic. Itcanbeseen
firsthand almost anywhere among groups ofchildren,
who, inmany cases, have notlived long enough to
learn tocounter such basic instinctual domination
tactics. Animalistic domination consists ofloud.
Manipulation oftheRoot Social Matrix&theFabric ofReality 136overbearing, bullish bohavior, combined with
physical intimidation. Italso includes time tested
tactics such aslaughtm, mocking, and teasing.
Animalistic tactics urn uaetl because they tend to
work, atleast among IIkmowhohave notrecognized
thetactics for what Ihoy are, orwhohave not
developed ways tocount nrthorn.
More deceitful domination attempts usually
consist ofpure mental warfate, hcontrolbot will

These kinds oltact lesmayappear tolerable,
ifsomewhat underhanded, toanobserver who is
unable tocomprehend thebigger picture. Itisjust
such seemingly minor domination attempts which will
eventually lead totheextinction ofthehuman race
ifallowed tocontinue. Aslong aswecontinue to
give positions ofpower tothose who take them,
instead oftothose whoshould hold them, weare
oppressing our own potential, and submitting to
being ledbythose who arc only Interested In
amassing power forthemselves atthe cost, ofthe
human race asawhole.
If acentrnlbot Isunsuccessful inhis
attempts toprogram another, hewill dooneoftwo
things. Iftheperson whoheistrying tocontrol is
acontrolbot aswell, theunsuccessful controlbot
will submit tothesuccessful one. Iftheperson the
controlbot istrying tocontrol hasanuninfected
mind, thecontrolbot will attempt todestroy the
human seen asanirreconcilable enemy.
These attacks differ from standard domination
attempts inthat there isnolonger anyroom for
compromise, oralliance. With adomination attempt,
Memetic Magic 137


the control bolalways leaves anoption for
submission open. The individual targeted for
domination canchoose tosubmit atanytime andthe
domination attempt will cease. Butwith anattack,
submission is nolonger apossibility. The
controlbot will attempt todestroy anyelement of
histarget which heisable todestroy, using any
tactics allowed bythe social situation andhis
programming. Attacks most often take theform of
humiliation, gossip, rumors, verbal assault, and a
general shunning stemming from aspecific social
matrix. Controlbots will nothesitate tousehastily
formed alliances intheir attempts toattack the
uninfected, andwill more than likely find many who
areeager tojoin intheassault.
Philosophy ofControl
The philosophy ofthe controlbot isthe
philosophy which hasbeen programmed into hisorher
mind. Controlbots have nophilosophies oftheir own,
for they donothave their own thoughts .Itis
important tonote that acontrolbot will actonthe
philosophy which hasbeen programmed into itsmind,
butthat thisphilosophy will notnecessarily bethe
same philosophy astheoneheld bythedominator to
whom itsubmits. Thedominator mayhave anentirely
different philosophy from those ruled. For atrue
dominator isonly concerned with domination, andas
such, will impart anyphilosophy into theminds of
theruled capable ofkeeping them under control.
Thus the effective dominator fashions false
philosophies andtransmits those philosophies into
theminds ofcontrolbots tomaintain hegemony.
Controlbots seek anysign ofdeviation from a
particular memetically prescribed social plan, and
then act toamend that deviation. Controlbots look
forthose whodonotrespect thesocial structure,
forthose whowould bypass impossibility walls, and
those whodonotusedomination asameans oftaking
social status .Controlbots are takers and never
willing givers. They will give only tothose whom
they submit, butthey only give because they donot
seethemselves asstrong enough totake.
Controlbots will hold people down asslaves
fortheir entire lives without somuch asasecond
138thought, andinsodoing believe they aredoing the
world, and their slaves, afavor. They have no
understanding ofthetrue larger picture, and no
desire toallow anyone towield power over them for
anyreason, even ifitisforthecollective good.
Avoiding
Theonly way tocompletely avoid controlbots
istoavoid people. Butsince hermits lead noone
but themselves, aleader must shun thepath of
isolation. Isolation initself canbeapowerful
tool fordeprogramming amind, and forgathering
strength, butisolation must always beameans, and
never anend. Aleader isolated from thepeople is
noleader atall.
Butitispossible tolive within society and
limit contact with controlbots asmuch aspossible.
Controlbots will exist inevery social situation,
andassuch will beunavoidable. Controlbots will

Grim asthough theoutlook mayappear, once a
leader learns torecognize domination attempts and
attacks forwhat they are, they canbecountered.
Butwhen acontrolbot launches adomination attempt,
they trytodisguise their attack. These attacks can
behidden under almost anyguise, butoften take the
form ofconcern, love, helpful advice, orsympathy.
When aperson believes they are hearing helpful
advice, they will notstrike back. Butwhen they

individual matter. Aleader canshow acontrolbot

shock azombie from complacency, butnone ofthis is
enough. Thefirst step toward evolution isusually
isolation. Thesimple actofisolating ahuman from
anything social: including friends, family,
television, movies, radios, books, andnewspapers --
cancause profound change. This isduetoacutting
off oftheprogramming which constantly bombards
minds. Since human beings areborn without direct
sociocultural programming, theprogramming ofthe
dominators must lieconstantly reinforced, or ahuman's truemind, their evolutionary spark, will
begin toshine through theillusion. Ifacontrolbotacts on Ilielessons learned during isolation, andis

Impossibility Walls
Since theconscious, thinking portion ofanaverage modern human
mind islittle more than theproduct ofasocioculturally programmed
memetic framework, theaverage human isonly capable ofthinking within
certain pre-programmed boundaries. Asthought leads toaction, the
average human cannot act inamanner notallowed bysociocultural
programming (until such atime astheprogramming loses itshold over
themind). Therefore, toaprogrammed human, certain actions within
sociocultural systems areforallpractical purposes impossible. The
boundaries which demarcate possible action from impossible action are
impossibility walls. Animpossibility wall isametaphysical concept
representing action which isimpossible totake because amind will not
allow theparticular action tobetaken.
Impossibility walls areconcurrently impregnable bastions andillusionary barriers which caneasily bestepped through, depending
entirely uponhowanindividual perceives thewall. Aslong asamind
142programmed toregard aparticular impossibility wall anan
Impassable barrier, thewall will remain animpassable barrier .Mill
Whan animpossibility wall isseen forwhat itis--anentirely mental
•fidillusionary memetic construct which serves todefine theboundai y
batween possible andimpossible action—itcanbebypassed with
ralative ease. Programmed menandwomen whoobserve another individual
bypassing animpossibility wall will consider thebypassing ofthe
Impossibility wall miraculous, because forallintents andpurposes
thayhave witnessed theoccurrence oftheimpossible. This isthetrue
ilafinltion oftheterm miracle.
Howelse could itbethat atiny butconsistent percentage of
every human population manages toexhibit miraculous movements within
social structures? Carpenters become movie stars, farmers become kings.
Theaverage programmed manbelieves (because hisprogramming makes him
halinve) that such social maneuvers are 'one inamillion', orthe
rusult ofblind luck. When inreality, anyhuman able toseeand
manipulate theRoot Social Matrix istheoretically able tomove from
anyoneposition intheRSMtoanyother position. Theonly thing
keeping anyhuman from moving atwill within theRoot Social Matrix is
aproper understanding oftheworkings oftheRoot Social Matrix.
Sociocultural programming inhibits human from seeing, studying, and
manipulating the RSM. Ifahuman learns tosee, comprehend, and
manipulate theRoot Social Matrix, hebecomes capable oftaking any
necessary action within theRSM, within thebounds oftheparticular
acceptable action matrix hecreates forhimself, tomove into any

Symbolic Bod'j Language
The symbolism inherent in ostensibly
commonplace motions oforganic structures (physical
organic bodies andportions ofbodies; beithands,
eyes, afacial expression, etc.) maybethesingle
most important element ofcommunication. Yet the
vast majority ofhuman beings allbutignore the
symbols projected bythebody just below thelevel
ofconscious comprehension. Inaworld where spoken
language isused almost exclusively asatool of
domination, deceit, andestablishing social status,
it isoften extremely difficult toascertain true
motives without theability toread symbolic body
language. Since fileconscious mind oftheaverage
human isthe result ofsociocultural programming,
theaverage human speaks words they areprogrammed
tospeak, seldom truly understanding why, orthe
true motives for speech. Theaverage human will
think theyunderstand whythey speak asthey do,but
inreality thethought oftheaverage human isthe
result ofmemetic programming replete with aims and
motives inaccessible toconscious thought.
Those skilled inthe art ofreading body
language learn quickly toallow little credence to
human speech. Human beings aresooften deceitful,
both tothemselves andothers, that words canalmost
never betaken atface value. Even those who
consciously seek tospeak words oftruth will have
little ornounderstanding oftheir ownminds, and
thus will notbeable totell thetruth even though
they desire todoso.Many programmed individuals
will speak what they believe tobethetruth, but
this so-called truth will benothing more than words
spit outbytheprogram which controls their mind.
Tounderstand anindividual's true feelings,
tounderstand ahuman better than they understand
themselves, anindividual must learn toread body
language.
Reading Body Language
Homo sapiens sapiens dominus share common
physical characteristics, which remain relatively
standard throughout agiven population. Thus, in
Manipulation oftheRoot Social Matrix&theFabric ofReality 144regards totheir bodies, they tend topossess Ihi'
same tools with which towork. Following this train
ofthought toitsnatural conclusion, certain body
movements tend tohave thesame meaning nomatter
which human makes these movements. Thus itisvery
possible tolearn toread these body motions much in
thesame way itispossible tolearn toread a
foreign language.
Afluency inthelanguage ofthebody canbe
aninvaluable tool. Most controlbots donotrealize
they speak acommon language born ofthememetic
programming which dominates their minds. Most
controlbots areunaware oftheindicators they emit.
Therefore, thetrue aims ofthememetic programming
which dominates themind ofacontrolbot will always
bevisible tothose whoknow howtolook. When an
individual learns toread body language, dominators
andcontrolbots canbespotted inseconds instead of

Donoteatfast food orjunk food. Your body

Reading isfood toagrowing mind. Without symbols
themind cannot grow. Reading isessential to

essential todeveloping magical power. Only stop
reading when themind isfull, that is,when it
rejects attempts tocontinue reading. Ifthis

Letter; Xavier Mattise tohisagent Brena Halloway,
dated October 11,2002:
Irealize that youhave notheard from mein
thebetter part oftwomonths, though perhaps, god
willing, some word regarding mycurrent condition
has been passed on to you by our mutual
acquaintance, Kira Cane. Ifully understand that our
relationship implies atacit obligation onmypart
tokeep youupdated onsuch seemingly innocuous
matters asmywhereabouts, andtheprogress ofmy
newest paint 1ngs .Without such correspondence onmy
part, Itwould befoolish toassume that, afruitful
buwInoHs relationship could bemaintained.
Therefore, Ibegofyoutoforgive myblatant
lapse of etlyuette, for Ihave been subject toa
profoundly disturbing experience here inGreece,
which hasleft meshaken andunsure astowhether I
shall ever setpaint tocanvas again. Perhaps, if
youwill consider theevents which have ledtomy
self-imposed isolation, youwill beable toaccept
myapologies, andallow methetime Isodesperately
need tocome toafinal decision regarding my
artistic future, orlack thereof.
Asyouwell know, myseminal exhibit Ion atthe
Blue Beach Gallery InLos Angeles was amajor
triumph. Due to your tIrelesa promotion, my
paint lugsmanaged tocompletely sell out, andinthe
process, Iestablished myname, however briefly, in
theupper echelon olmodern artists after nearly a
decade o|billet struggle.

first time inmyall-too bitter life Ihadbeen
allowed asipofthesweet nectar ofsuccess. Iwas
inthemood tocelebrate. Ihadmade over ten
thousand dollars that night andwanted totravel, go
Memetic MagicManipulation oftheRoot Social Matrix&theFabric ofReality 149


someplace andnomsomething Ihadalways wanted to
see. Since ilappeared that those mythic purveyors
ofart i:ilInInspiration andglory, theMuses, had
finally chosen tosmile down upon mefrom their
Olympian aanctunry, itseemed only fitting that I
should choose Greece asmydestination. So Icalled
my Iwoclosest friends, Kira Cane andCorbin Bishop,
andmade arrangements that very night toleave the
to 1 Iiiw Ingday.
Greece waseverything wehadimagined itwould
be. 1gotsocaught upIntheancient temples and
exotic sanctuaries that. Ineglected tokeep theone
prom ino Itradmade myself before leaving; that I
would compose atleast one sketch (later tobe
finalized asafull-fledged fraluting) onthetrip.
Soinstead ofvisit IngtheOracle atDelphi, I
decided wowould travel tothe F'indus Mountain
range, where, tree from thestress ofmore tourist-
ridden /.ones, Iwould compose mysketch inrelative
peace.
Atasmall family-run hotel atthefoot ofthe
Pindus Mountains, Ibegan tocompose that accursed
sketch. Kira, Corbin, and Ihadtaken ourlunch out
onto thebalcony ofourrented room, from where we
were afforded afine view ofthewide-stretching
Pindus range. Ascarred andimposing mountain, that
which wasclosest totheinn,dominated thehorizon.
Aslaras Thadbeen able toascertain, thelocals
avoided themountain, claiming that itwashaunted,
inhabited byspirits, orsomething ofthelike. Our
innkeeper, afriendly enough woman, was only
moderately proficient intheEnglish language, but I
managed toextract thecommon name ofthemountain.
TheHouse oftheNine Sisters, ormore properly
Helicon, from her.
Thename intrigued me.Yetthemountain itself
did not .Nevertheless, Tdecided would attempt to
extract thehidden essence from that rather bland
mountain asasort, ofultimate test ofmyskills,
anddisplay itonmycanvas.
Whydid Ibecome apainter? When people askme
this question Itend totell them what they want to
hear. Iclaim painting isabeneficial form of
psycho-therapy, awaytokeep myself sane. When I
paint Iexorcise theterrible demons frommymind.
Manipulation oftheRoot Social Matrix&theFabric ofReality 150orsome other more orless standard line. After all,
1was trying tobuild myimage asanartist,
because, like itornot, image sells more paintings
than artistic skill ever will. Whether this isright
orwrong isbeside thepoint. Most people whobuy
artdon't understand art. Therefore, ifapainter
wants tosell alotofpaintings hehastoconform
tothe image which will attract the kind of
attention heislooking for. Oratleast that is
What Itellmyself tojustify myactions.
Howdid Ireally come tobeapainter? For a
short period oftime Itook high doses of
nootropics, popularly known bythe catch-phrase
nmart drugs, inthehopes these drugs would give me
nome insight astohow Imight getahead inthis
unforgiving world. Specifically, Iexperimented with
asynergistic mixture ofpiracetum andhydcrglnc.

five yeais later other people call medpainter. The
tunny thing Is,when people call meapainter, I
know they're missing the point. Myso-called
paintings arelittle more than colored-in symbols.
What Ireally amisasymbolist .
Ifirmly believe that thenootropics made me
more subconsciously sensitive. Iguess that's the
best way toput it. Sometimes, after Ipainted
particularly profound images, Iwould seethose same
images later that day, orlater that, week, inthe
clouds. Idon't mean that Iwould seeanunusual
cloud formation andimagine that itappeared similar
towhat Ihadpainted. Imean that clouds actually
became those images, remaining sountil Iforced
myself tolook away.
Atfairly regular intervals, Iwould be
overcome byspecific physical symptoms. These
symptoms included lightheadedness, aslight
expansion ofmind, andanenhanced range ofvisual
acuity. Inmore general terms, Iwould feel like I
wasjust attheverge offalling into adeep trance.

oxactly pulled her, though wehaddated, onandoff,
for many years. Though our relationship wasprimarily based onwhat Ilike tosarcastically callfriendship, wehadbeenphysically intimate onafew
occasions.
Wehad anunderstanding. Ibelieved in
freedom, plain andsimple. Shecould come andgoas
she pleased, and was encouraged to have
relationships with other men. Imade nosecret that
Ibelieved controlling relationships were tools of
those seeking todominate others, andmarriages were
little better than slavery. Kira, however, wasmore

blended into the mountain, climbing gradually
towards thesummit. Some presence seemed totake
control ofmyhand, forcing ittodraw ofitsown

without any conscious intent, nine vague female
figures, cloaked from head totoeinhooded robes,
climbing those same stairs. Ihadbeen sketching
with such rapidity that when Ifinished myhand was
trembling duetoexertion.
Iangled the canvas under the reflected
sunlight. After afewmoments ofclose examination,
Iallowed agrin totrace thecorners ofmylips. It
was akeeper. Thehard part wasdone. Iwould not
leave Greece empty handed.
Kira rose from herchair. "Shall wego?"
She was already stepping down the stairs

discovered the remnants ofanancient path, or
stairway, leading upthe side ofthemountain.
Needless tosay, wewere allastounded, Kira perhaps
even more sothan me.Sheknew full well, asdid I,
that there wasabsolutely noway Icould have seen

"This could bestairs, orapath." Sheshook

Though Ididn't know exactly what she was

olthemountain. Ilooked atKira andCorbin, and
they atme,then stepped asboldly asIcould into
thedarkness.
The cave was claustrophobically narrow.
Judging from thelight trickling in, Idiscerned a
passage winding about thirty meters back into the
blackness. Allalong this narrow path, slabs ofrock
jutted dangerously from theceiling andthefloor.
With mysel Iinthe lead, westepped cautiouslythrough this maze olsharpened stalactites. Twenty
meters in, Tstopped. Having stepped outside the
range oftheoutside light, itbecame clear that thetunnel itself was illuminated by avariety ofglowing fungus which coated thewalls ofthetunnellike fluorescent blue velvet.
Nowthat Icould seesome distance ahead, it
was clear wewere approaching the end ofthepassage, where the tunnel opened into alarger
cavern.
Asweapproached theendofthetunnel, Kiracalled for metostop. Not feeling entirelyconfident with myfooting, IdidasIwastold. Kirareached uptograsp myshoulder, so Iwould knowthat shewasthere, andstepped past me,carefully,totheendofthetunnel. Shereached up,tracing aline with herfinger. There, etched inthegranite,just below theentrance tothe chamber, were astring ofgolden Greek words.

"The mythological women whoinspire thepoets

"Thevery same."
"This must beadream ,"
Iwhispered, as I
.stepped totheedge oftheprecipice.
Thecavern wasoval-shaped, about onehundred
meters incircumference andthirty inheight. A
polished marble floor covered themajority ofthe
cavern, running uptotheedge ofanunderground
river, which dropped offinto thedarkness under the
impenetrable granite wall atthefarside. Thegrim
waterfall's melodic echo reverberated through the
chamber, adisconcerting andtranquil hymn offored
tothe forgotten past. The ancient (book term

cavern somehow related to areawakening, or
temombl ance, oftheforgotten truths ofthepast?
AnImpressively ornate golden doorway, covered
inrunes andsapphires, wassetinto thefargranite
wall. Eight tunnels circled thecavern very much
like theeight points onacompass.
Iclimbed carefully down into the chamber;
Kira andCorbin followed soon after. Wewalked to
thefoot oftheriver, toapoint just before it
dropped offinto thedarkness. There stood amarble
pedestal, ontopofwhich rested anivory slab, into
which tenGreek words hadbeen lriser lbod. Eight
words hadbeen engraved ontheeight points ofa
golden compass. Another word was inthecenter of
thecompass, and afinal word layatthebottom of
theslab, completely alone. Kira traced ontheivory
with her finger, reading off the names onthe
compass, onebyone.
"Clio, Euterpe, Thaleia, Melpomene,

"Tartarus must bedown there... then this," Kira
continued, motioning tothe river, "must be

"I'm getting really bad vibes," Corbin
offered. "What doyousaywecheck outoneortwoof

This sounded like awise plan tome,andKira
concurred. The obvious choice for further

tothecorresponding cave atthesouthwest corner of

wewalked upandinto thecavern.
Ashort flight ofcracked granite stairs led
toalong, fungus-illuminated hall, which wasfor
themost part, butnotentirely, straight. Thefloor
wasmarble, covered with paintings andinscriptions
ofsimplistic beauty, but Ididnoteven allow these
decorations more than aninstant's notice, forthe
walls, orrather, what was inthe walls, had
attracted myundivided attention.
Large empty sections oneither side ofthe
wall had been chiseled out ofthe rock. These
holding pens, for lack ofabetter word, were
evident, along theentire length ofthehall. Each of
these holding pens appeared tocontain, however
unbelievable this may sound, alive animal. The
three enclosures closest tomewere inhabited bya
black panther, atiger, and amountain lion,
respectively. Allthree animals were intheprime of
health. Thepanther, for one, wasdisconcertingly
lithe, muscular, and agile. Crouched asthough
intent onspringing, itjudged mewith glowing
emerald eyes. When Ifirst spotted theagile cat,

Iwascertain Iwasdoomed, forwith Kira and

from the panther's lethal trajectory. But,
astonishingly, atthemid-point ofitsleap, where
theouter edge oftheholding penmetthehall, the
panther struck apreviously invisible barrier. The
barrier flashed brilliantly inallthecolors ofthe
rainbow, tracing acircular pattern analogous tothe
contours ofthepanther's body. Thepanther bounced
gracefully back from theimpact, twisting inmidair

Tosaythat wewere amazed todiscover those
ferociously beautiful animals intheir fantastically

As Ipondered these questions, thepanther
melted from thedarkness into thedimfluorescent

cage, notmore than anarm's length distant, it
stood, balancing itself onthebarrier with itstwo

across myline ofsight like psychedelic sonar

Thepanther was animposing figure, standing

cage, andwecontinued oursearch.
Wewalked thelength ofthehall, discovering
animals locked within most ofthose holding pens. We
saw lions, jaguars, tigers, panthers, cougars,
mountain lions, and alynx. There were undoubtedly
some animals which wehadbeen unable tosee, who
remained hidden back somewhere inside their pens.
Theanimals were fantastic intheir ownright,
but they paled incomparison with some ofthe

cages. Just. writing ofthese strange things wesaw

elegant efficiency ofitslethal approach. Afull
ten meters from Corbin, the panther sprung,
extending itsrazor sharp claws, landing amoment
later with itsfull weight onCorbin's unprotected
back.
Mygod, Brena; Icanstill seeitclearly as
ifitwere happening this very moment.
Corbin must have hadhisbreath knocked outof
him, lorhemade scarcely asound when hedropped to
thefloor. Merciless inhismaulinq, theoutcome of
thebriel struggle wasdetermined inaninstant.
Corbin had nochance, so Iturned myeyes
immediately away from thegruesome scene toKira,
whohadherback pressed against thefarside ofthe
hall, upagainst theimage ofPolyhymnia. Shewasin
shock, soIshouted forhertorun, runwhile the
panther wasstill occupied.
Myurgent pleas snapped Kira out from her
shocked immobility, andsheregained hercomposure
just intime todart past theengaged panther.
Neither Kira nor Tever even considered intervening
inthestruggle, forafter witnessing thepower,
agility, andferocity ofthat panther weknew it
would besuicide toeven try. Thebest that wecould
doatthat point wastryandsave ourselves.
Kira, terrified outofhermind, ran right
past me,outinto theentry chamber, without aword.
Iwasstrongly tempted tofollow suit, butwhen Iglanced back atthepanther, Isawthat ithad
finished with Corbin, andwascrouching tospring
after thefleeing Kira. Thesite wasgruesome; the
panther's front legs, paws, face, andteeth were
doused indull dripping blood, glowing ominouslyunder thefungus light. Corbin was alifeless mess
atitsfeet.
Awave offurious anger made mythoughts turn
red, red astheblood which laytestament tothe
panther's wicked nature. Iwasfilled with ananimal
162fUEy, born oftheneed forself-preservation and
revenge.
Thepanther sprung, andwithin afewstrides
hadreached topspeed. Itsemerald eyes were locked
onKira, just nowpassing meonmyright. Iknew if
Ididn't block itspath, thepanther would overtake
Kira before shecould reach therelative safety of
theupper entrance tunnel. So,without thinking,
perhaps asasmall token ofatonement forthedeath
ofCorbin, Iblocked theentrance tothehall with
mybody. Thepanther was notgoing togetpast
without going through me. Iknew Ihadnochance of
prevailing against that lissome beast, butperhaps
mydeath would provide Kira thefewextra moments
sheneeded toclimb upoutoftheentry chamber to
safety.
Sothis ishow itends, Ithought, asthe
panther bore down upon meinslow motion, a
miraculously graceful shadow shedding light upon the
frailly and r Iunm Inorm ofthehuman form. The
paid hot ctoucliod and leapt mid-st ride, literally
gliding onair. Itensed, preparing for thr'muscular
we 11|tdwith might mercifully knock menumb into the
eternal blackness.
Butinthedimlight Imust have misjudged the
distance between us,forthepanther came upshort,
landing onallfours tenmeters infront ofme.Its
posture rigid, thepanther slid onallfours, coming
toastop directly infront ofme,itsnose touching
mychest. Ireached uptostrike thebeast, butat
thefinal moment Iheld back, forwhen Iglared down
into those wide emerald orbs, Irecognized thelove
ofadogforitsmaster.
The fury Ifelt atCorbin's death was so
intense that Itrembled, longing tostrike that
wicked beast, strike itagain andagain andagain,
beat thespark oflife outofthose eyes with my
bare hands. Butintheend, Icould notbring myself
tovent myrage upon theloving creature atmyfeet.
Redrage fled from measquickly asithadarrived,
replaced byaneminently more rational fear ofthe
powerful panther atmyheels.
When Idropped myarmtomyside, thepanther
leapt upunexpectedly onto itshind legs, balancing
itself with itspaws pressed against mychest. I

recoiled insl. iactively, fearing thecolled, lithe
power pressed upagainst myflesh. Ttbecame alltoo
clear that ifthepanther decided todotomewhat
ithaddone toCorbin, there would benothing I
could dotostop it.Noamount ofrage would allow a
mere mantoovercome physical power bred andmolded
over thecourse ofmillions ofyears ofevolution.
So Ididwhat Ihad todotosurvive. I
encouraged, with ashaky voice, thelove ofthe
panther. Iwaseven sobold astoreach outwith a
trembling hand andpettheterrible beast onthetop
ofitssleek ebony head. Itdropped again toall
fours andrubbed upagainst me,purring.
Asthepanther dropped below myline ofsight,
Twasonce again able topeer down totheendofthe
hall. There, where Kira hadbeen standing notmore
than a Iowmoments betore, stood amasked woman. The
dimout ! inooftierbody glowed, most likely dueto
thereflection ofthedimfungus-light offherwhite
tunic, which covered herfrom shoulder tofoot. Her
hair waslong, brunette, andbraided upabove her
head. She wore anarrow single-beamed crown of
brass. Herfeet were partially covered byopen air
sandals. Butmygaze wasdrawn tothemask. The
features painted onthemask were feminine and
expressionless, andthis oddlack offeature struck
adeep disharntonic chord within me.
Howshecould have come tobethere, standing
alone attheendofthehall, without mynotice, I
didnot know. But themoment she fell within my
gaze, themasked woman raised herarms outonboth
sides, asthough shewished toembrace me, and
stepped measured paces down thehall towards me.
This was avery disturbing sight. Iamcertain I
would have turned and ran if Ihad not been
concerned that thepanther would view myresponse as
fear andgive chase. SoIhadnochoice buttowait
asthemasked woman made herspectral approach.
Thepanther's ears straightened asthemasked
woman neared, anditwhirled smoothly around toleap
upinto herarms.
"Mybeautiful, beautiful, beast," themasked
woman cooed with adoration, hugging thepanther like
itwas acommon cat. "Ithasbeen solong since I
have held youinmyarms."
Manipulation oftheRoot Social Matrix&theFabric ofReality 164Iknew then that themasked woman wasnohuman
fating ofthekind Iknew. Forwhen shespoke, the
tone ofhervoice possessed amost amazing quality.
When shespoke shesounded like shewassinging. One
moment her voice was clearly understandable as
common speech with afeminine tone, while thenext I
could noteven payattention toherwords, forthey
dripped from her mouth, indescribably beautiful
musical chords. Upon whom they bless ,their words
will flow forth from their mouths like thesweetest
nectar. Despite being utterly entranced byher
wondrous ode, Iwasable topick outthelyrics: We
know how tospeak many false things,asthough they
were true, weknow too, when wewish, toutter
aletheia.
Then themasked woman straightened, looking up
from hercatwith those expressionless blank eyes.
"Mighty Zeus isangry. Hehasjudged humankind no
longer fittoreign askings ofthis world."
1did notknow howtorespond.
"Ilnvn youoome tofine myprevious beasts? You
linvo been given thekey."
”1haver nokey," 1replied.
"The keyisinyour hand."
Ilooked down anddiscovered Iwas still
clutching thesketch Ihadcomposed ofthepanther.
What hadshemeant? Wassheimplying that Icould
free theanimals intheroom simply bysketching
them? When Ilooked back themasked woman andthe
panther hadstepped beyond me.
"Come with menow. Youmust free all ofmy
pets. Itisthewill ofZeus."
Shestrode out into the oval entry chamber
with thepanther ather side, and Ireluctantly
followed. Shestopped briefly attheedge ofthe
river thatplunged down into theblackness.
"Gomypet; youarefree tofeed ontheflesh
oftheEarth."
With that, thepanther whirled, took four
long, smooth strides, and leapt uptowards the
tunnel high above; thevery same tunnel which led
outside, totheworld. Kira had tohave been up
there somewhere.
Iwasabout togive chase, attempt towarn
Kira oftheimpending danger, butwasstopped bythe

hypnotic tonon ofthemasked woman. "The only one
who canhelp hernow isherself," she sung, as
though reading mymind.
Tlooked onwith fear andaweasmymelodious
host- began toslowly remove hermask. Asthemask
rose from her face, thegolden door. Calliope's
door, began toswing open ofitsownaccord behind
her.
"Free mypets, Xavier. Free mybeautiful
beau in..."
At Ihevery moment themasked woman pulled the
mask enl Irely offherface, shevanished. Though I
donotknow with theaidofwhat godorforce she
managed It/perhaps Itwas, assheclaimed, dueto
Lhewill of /iniirr hinine 1I.One moment she was
standing Infront ofmeand thenext shephase-
shifted Into another reality. Behind where shehad
been .standing thedoorway leading Into theHall of
Calliope swung Ially open, bathing me in a
fluorescent azure radiance.
Iwalked slowly upandthrough Ihat.golden
doorway into anindescribable place where nohuman
wasmeant towander. Alonghallway stretched asfar
as Icould see, descending ataslight angle down
into alingering sapphire mist. Ifeel certain that
beyond this layanother hall, and another, and
another; each leading deeper into theheart ofthe
Earth, each filled with inexpressibly beautiful, but
terribly malevolent, pets.
Itell you that the Hall ofCalliope is
indescribable notbecause Iamunable tospeak of
those fantastic mythological monstrosities Isaw
held within thecountless holding pens, and not
because Iamunable topaint images ofthose same

There Istood, althethreshold oftheHall of

goblins, theelves, theunicorns, thedragons, the
medusa, thetitans, thegorgons, theangels, the
genii, andthe daemons. Itwaswithin mygrasp to
