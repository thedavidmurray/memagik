# Visual Design Notes for Knowledge Graph Visualization

## Game UI Inspiration Analysis

### Civilization Tech Trees

The Civilization series offers excellent examples of knowledge visualization through its tech trees:

1. **Hierarchical Structure**
   - Tech trees are organized across different research fields and historical eras
   - Clear progression paths with branching options
   - Technologies unlock new capabilities as players advance

2. **Visual Design Elements**
   - Color coding to differentiate technology categories
   - Icons and imagery that represent concepts
   - Connection lines showing relationships and dependencies
   - Era-based organization creating temporal context

3. **Interactive Features**
   - Hover/click for detailed information
   - Visual indicators for completed, in-progress, and available technologies
   - Contextual information showing benefits and requirements

### Command and Conquer Interfaces

Command and Conquer games provide inspiration for strategic information display:

1. **Sidebar Design**
   - Clean, functional sidebar for navigation and control
   - Minimalist approach that avoids overwhelming the user
   - Clear visual hierarchy of information

2. **Map and Strategic View**
   - Tactical overview of resources and elements
   - Use of iconography to represent different units/concepts
   - Color-coding for different factions/categories

3. **Resource Management**
   - Clear visual indicators for resources and relationships
   - Intuitive navigation between different view modes
   - Contextual information provided when needed

### Isometric Design Elements

Isometric game interfaces offer unique visual approaches:

1. **Perspective and Depth**
   - 45-degree tilted perspective creating sense of depth
   - 3D-like appearance on 2D screens
   - Visual layering to represent relationships

2. **Visual Clarity**
   - Clean grid-based layouts
   - Consistent visual style
   - Balance between detail and readability

## Application to Knowledge Graph Visualization

Based on the research, here are key elements to incorporate into our knowledge graph visualization:

### Visual Structure
- **Hierarchical Layout**: Organize concepts in a tech-tree style progression
- **Isometric Perspective**: Use isometric design for the graph to create depth and visual interest
- **Connection Lines**: Clear visual connections between related concepts
- **Sidebar Navigation**: Command & Conquer-inspired sidebar for filtering and navigation

### Visual Attributes
- **Color Coding**: Different colors for concept categories (similar to tech trees)
- **Node Sizing**: Vary node size based on importance or connectivity
- **Icons and Imagery**: Representative icons for different concept types
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between primary and secondary concepts

### Interactive Elements
- **Hover Information**: Detailed information on hover (like Civilization tech descriptions)
- **Zoom Levels**: Different levels of detail based on zoom (strategic vs tactical view)
- **Filtering Options**: Ability to filter by concept type or relationship
- **Path Highlighting**: Highlight related concepts when selecting a node

### Aesthetic Direction
- **Color Palette**: Draw from both game series - earth tones from Civilization, high contrast from C&C
- **Typography**: Clean, readable fonts with clear hierarchy
- **UI Framing**: Game-like frames and panels for information display
- **Background**: Subtle grid or texture reminiscent of strategy game maps

This design approach will transform the abstract knowledge graph into an engaging, game-inspired interactive experience that encourages exploration and understanding.
